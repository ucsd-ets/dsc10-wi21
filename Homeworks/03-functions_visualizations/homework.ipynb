This video game franchise, which began with Pokémon Red and Green in 1996, is one of the most iconic and highest-grossing video game series of all time. Pokémon is currently in its 7th generation, and has had games spanning the GameBoy, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo Switch. \n",

Trainers can further their journey by playing in Gyms and beating trainers there! There is also a Pokedex, which is an encyclopedia\tfor Pokémon. In the games, when you discover new Pokémon, you get to add to the Pokedex!\n",

    "Every Pokémon has its own attributes, such as an elemental type, hit points, and various attack and defense statistics. In this question, we will be simplifying the attributes of Pokémon since there are many more, like height, weight, and sex. Although there are multiple of each Pokémon (for example, there are tons of Pikachu that are all electric type, but vary slightly in their HP and other attributes), this dataset just contains a summary for that specific Pokémon. For example, the dataset shows that Bulbasaur has 49 attack points. However, that is just an average for all the Bulbasaurs since each one is distinct."
