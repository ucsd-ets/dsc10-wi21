In WWII, the Allies wanted to know how many tanks the Germans had (some number `N`), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the tanks' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`).  For example, one estimate was twice the mean of the sample serial numbers.\n",

In real life, if the Allies had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling.  They didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations we did.  So that was useful as an exercise in *understanding random variation* in an estimate, but not as a tool for practical data analysis.\n",
