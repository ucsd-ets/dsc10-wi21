    "Welcome to Project 1! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is *comprehensive*, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life\"."

With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",

If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours or your team's chatroom on Campuswire. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. \n",

    "\n",
    "During the end of the year 2019, the novel coronavirus started spreading around the world, causing many people to contract COVID-19. It didn't take long for the virus to spread from Wuhan, China to pretty much everywhere else in the world. At first, no one realized the severity of the virus and its potential to change lives as drastically as it has. In February 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States started to grow exponentially. Various measures, like face covering regulations and stay at home mandates, have helped mitigate some effects of the virus, but the virus is still spreading rapidly. In the US, there have been over 24 million cases of COVID-19, and over 400,000 people have died as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be analyzing COVID-19 data in the United States. Specifically, we will look at national data for fall 2020, broken down by state and by day, and also local data about outbreaks in San Diego.\n",

The questions that are part of each section are also listed in this outline. Questions that are **bolded** are questions whose results will be used later in the project. Unbolded questions are ones that won't be referenced later and can be safely skipped if you get stuck.
