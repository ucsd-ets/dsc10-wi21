    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This assignment is due Thursday, March 11 at 11:59pm. You are given six slip days throughout the quarter to extend deadlines. See the syllabus for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may **work in pairs** for this assignment, and you are encouraged to do so! If you work in a pair, you must work with someone from your team, and you should submit one notebook to Gradescope for the both of you, while designating your partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for the final exam and your future in data science. If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook or supplemental textbook. If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section often will help clarify the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels or that your answer is of the correct type. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** First, **start early**. As you may know from the Midterm Project, projects are complex and time-consuming. Second, develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells, and you can add additional cells as needed. Don't try to do everything in one cell without seeing the intermediate output. In particular, for simulations where you need to do something many times, first just do the process once and make sure the results look reasonable. Then wrap your code inside a for loop to repeat it. Similarly, for defining functions, first write code that will produce the desired output for a single fixed input. Then, once you know it's working, you can put that code inside a function and change the input to be a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Simulations.** If any of your cells are taking more than five minutes to run, you are probably doing something wrong. You can sometimes speed things up by making sure you have a table of only the rows and columns you need to do your analysis, which should be defined outside the for loop of your simulation. Make sure your table is as small as possible in both rows and columns. When possible, try to avoid using additional for loops and queries inside a simulation, and see if a faster method, like a numpy method or groupby, could be used instead. \n",

    "GoFundMe is an online crowdfunding platform where people can raise funds for personal, business and charitable work. GoFundMe enables users to create their own fundraising website, where they can describe their fundraising cause, upload photos and videos, and set a goal for how much they want to raise. People can also share the fundraiser through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and email. \n",

    "In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset of fundraisers that users have posted on GoFundMe. This data was scraped from the GoFundMe main page, category pages, and campaign URLs. The data was gathered in early 2021, pulling the most recent fundraisers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was compiled by UCSD students Gauri Samith, Derek Leung, Emily Chen, and Vincent Lee for use in a personal project, organized through the Data Science Student Society’s Projects Committee, and they were kind enough to share it with us for this DSC 10 project. If you want to see the analysis they've done on this dataset and see some other great data science projects, check out the [DS3 Project Showcase](data/proj_showcase.png), on Monday, February 22, 2021 from 3-5pm.
