Sinai hospital after successfully coming off a ventilator 7 days prior.  Her premature daughter was delivered at 30 weeks and is in the NICU.  The arrest lasted 8 minutes and has left her with anoxic brain injury due to lack of oxygen and presently she’s awake but minimally conscious, not able to respond to sounds, touch or commands. Sylvia will need significant long-term acute cognitive and physical therapy to help give her a fighting chance for her baby Esther and her 3 year old toddler Jay.  Sylvia’s union insurance unfortunately covers only 30 days of acute rehabilitation - at centers like Kessler in NJ, Moss Rehab in PA and TIRR Memorial in Texas - a handful across the country that specialize in recovery for people suffering from severe disorders of consciousness due to lack of oxygen to the brain like Sylvia.Sylvia’s family has been fighting early on to get her the best care possible, from transferring her to Mt. Sinai hospital and getting her into an acute rehabilitation center.  Please help Sylvia get the care she needs to be there for her family. About Sylvia:Sylvia is 35, a nurse at Brookdale Hospital, wife and mother of 2 young children.  Sylvia is truly loved by her friends & family for her warmth, dedication to people who are underserved and love for God.  Sylvia sadly contracted COVID19 while working to help other sick patients and now she and her children need your support. Your generous donation will go to Sylvia’s medical expenses and care for her children.  We thank you and cherish your gift of love."

Tommy Rivers and his beautiful family have been a shining light guiding so many through dark times; now is the time to reciprocate and prove that love is, indeed, always the answer. As some of you may know, almost a month ago, Tommy Rivs was admitted to the ICU with respiratory issues. After several weeks of testing and a lung biopsy, doctors discovered the presence of cancer. Specifically, Tommy Rivers was diagnosed with Primary Pulmonary NK T-Cell Lymphoma, a very rare and aggressive form of Lymphoma. Tommy was moved to a hospital in Scottsdale, AZ, where he is receiving chemotherapy under the guidance and expertise of some of the leading lymphoma physicians in the world.  As you can imagine, this treatment is expensive, and Tommy and his family could use all of the financial support they can get.Your generosity can help lighten the load, so that he can focus on recovery, as he taught us to do. Your kind donation will go directly to Steph and Tommy to help deal with the financial repercussions of his current condition, so they can focus on healing and supporting one another.

On Saturday, May 30, 2020, Brandon was walking to get something to eat in downtown Dallas, and encountered protesters as he walked.  Police officers began walking towards the protestors and with no warning or provocation, they opened fire on the crowd and struck Brandon in his left eye.  Brandon had broken no laws.  Brandon had to undergo surgery where they were unable to salvage his eye and had to remove it.  My son’s entire left side of his face was broken including his nose and jaw. On Wednesday, his 26th birthday, he was released from the hospital and was simply just grateful to be alive.  The officer that committed this heinous crime has been protected by law enforcement and therefore we are unable to hold them accountable at this moment.  Brandon has been permanently maimed and is now disabled.  He has a long way to go with medical and life expenses.  We acknowledge that times are tough and appreciate anything that you can donate for my son.  Thanks you for all of the messages of encouragement as well.  TY SINCERELY BRANDON SAENZ AND FAMILY"

Medical,Rise Up for Rhys,"Redondo Beach, CA",396170.0,500000.0,158,3.1K,2.3K,"6 month old Rhys needs a life saving drug that costs $2.1 million. Follow Rhys’s story and current updates at www.RiseUpForRhys.org and on Instagram @RiseUpForRhysIn May of 2019 while on vacation in Scotland, Rory and I found out we were pregnant (though I already knew - mother’s intuition kicks in early!)  Our baby girl was due on Christmas Day, and after a perfectly healthy pregnancy and 20 hours of labor, we welcomed her 3 weeks early on December 4, 2019 at 12:13pm. Even though I had sworn not to give my children confusing-to-pronounce Welsh names as my mother had done to me, we decided to name her Rhys (pronounced Reese). Overnight she made us a family, and even her fur brother Bruce was absolutely in love. (Jury is still out for Tony).Rhys had been a healthy baby, loving her baths, walks outside, and cuddles and kisses from her doggies. As Rhys approached 4 months, that mother’s intuition was nagging me - I noticed that she seemed to be falling behind on milestones other babies her age were hitting. She always struggled with tummy time, and wasn’t able to roll over or hold her head up for very long. At her 4 month check up, our pediatrician said she just had low muscle tone and recommended physical therapy. At her next check up at 6 months, the pediatrician immediately noted Rhys’ lack of progression and expressed concerns that she may have Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic condition we had never heard of before. A quick Google search, confirmed every parent’s greatest fear: ""The number 1 genetic disease that kills most babies up to 2 years old."" Appointments with Geneticists and Pediatric Neuro-muscular Specialists were set, blood and saliva tests ordered, and the waiting began. We hoped it was something else less severe, easier to treat, less devastating. ANYTHING but SMA. After 2 weeks, the longest 2 weeks of our lives, we received the heartbreaking diagnosis - Rhys has SMA Type 1, the most severe form of the disease.SMA is a terminal muscle degenerative disease, affecting eating, speaking, moving and even breathing. It results in muscle wasting where infants often die of respiratory failure ​before reaching the age of two. With SMA Type 1, each day means loss of specialized nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and muscle cell death. It is so rare that just a few years ago, there was no treatment. Parents had to watch as their child was able to move less and less, becoming unable to eat and breath on their own.There is no cure for SMA, but in the last 2 years, two life changing treatments have become available. One treatment, SPINRAZA, works on the SMN2 gene, which is a less active copy of the SMN1 gene (the gene that is missing/non-functioning in a person with SMA). By boosting production of SMN2, SPINRAZA supports muscle development and provides a level of improvement. SPINRAZA is very expensive at $750K in the first year and $375K every year thereafter for life. In August of 2019, a new gene therapy, ZOLGENSMA was approved by the FDA. It replaces the missing/non-functioning SMN1 gene with a new functional copy. This medicine provides life changing improvement, some patients are even able to walk independently. Such a miracle drug comes at a cost, and ZOLGENSMA is the most expensive drug in the world at $2.1 million USD. Because SMA Type 1 is aggressive and degenerative, this is a race against time. With each day that passes, motor neurons in Rhys’ sweet little body are becoming inactive. All funds raised will go to Rhys’s medical care including gene therapy (out-of-pocket responsibility outside of insurance not known at this time), physical and occupational therapy, mobility and development equipment, etc. She has a lifetime ahead of her and will need continuous treatment for the best chance at a full life. In the case there are additional funds beyond Rhys’s needs, they will go to Cure SMA, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for this devastating disease. Every child should have the best possible chance at life - please join us to surround our happy little girl in love and support.

Medical,Support Chelsea Ellis's Mission To Recovery,"Buffalo, NY",350852.0,515000.0,180,2.7K,10.9K,"On behalf of Chelsea Ellis, her family is seeking monetary donations to fund medical expenses for spinal cord injury rehabilitation, not covered by health insurance.  A 3-month stay at $5,000 per day, along with approximately $55,000 for air ambulance transport to and from the facility, means she will require $515,000 to get state-of-the-art rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado. This rehabilitation is critical to her future well-being and ultimately to her return to home. Chelsea’s family is praying for a generous outpouring of donations to facilitate paying for these extraordinary costs.Chelsea is a 29-year-old woman who miraculously survived catastrophic injuries sustained on April 15, 2020.  She was a pedestrian on the sidewalk in the City of Buffalo, NY when a police SUV responding to a 911 call, crashed into a car, lost control and struck her. She flew a great distance and suffered multiple fractures, including severe injuries to her spine and brain stem.  Chelsea is currently quadriplegic and ventilator dependent.  She has miraculously regained cognitive function and has the same great personality. She engages with family and friends via FaceTime using facial expressions, eye motions and by mouthing words. Chelsea is a joyful, selfless human being who leads a life of Discipleship. She is a teacher of English to speakers of other languages and loves refugees. She recently became a realtor with the ambition of finding decent housing for the immigrant/refugee community in Buffalo, NY.  Chelsea has done missionary work in 12 different countries around the world. Her love for Christ and passion for spreading His word is her main objective in life. Within the last year, Chelsea bought a house and started an educational ministry out of her home to help refugee children and their families. She also regularly held Bible study in her home hoping that others might also be empowered by the love of Christ.  Friends of Chelsea created a Facebook Group entitled “Chelsea’s Army” which is now over 2,100 members strong.  Individuals from this group have been fervently praying for her over the past six very challenging weeks.  Places of worship and people in all 50 of the United States and in 72 different countries around the globe are praying for her restoration. Chelsea has lived a life of helping others. Now she needs YOUR help!

Medical,PLEASE HELP ME IN THE BATTLE FOR MY LIFE,"New Milford, NJ",512970.0,600000.0,41,7.8K,6.7K,"PLEASE HELP ME IN THE BATTLE FOR MY LIFE. My name is Mimosa Selimaj. I am a wife and proud mother of a beautiful 2-year-old boy, Dean, and we live in New Milford, a small town in northern New Jersey. I was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.  I need your help with medical expenses and family support in the fight for my life.On July 13th of this year, my entire world was turned upside down.  I was rushed to the ER with severe pain in my abdomen and the doctors discovered a large mass on my ovary. This set off a whirlwind of tests to understand the root cause of my illness. Days after my 35th birthday, and less than 2 years after having Dean, I was diagnosed with colon cancer.  The doctors initially thought it was ovarian cancer. They said they had to remove my ovary and I was rushed in for emergency surgery. I was horrified because my husband and I had just started trying for our second child.  The doctors gave us hope by explaining that I could become pregnant with one ovary, but our hearts were heavy. As it turned out, this was far from the worst of our problems. Days later, I received a diagnosis that will forever shake me to my core. I have Stage 4 colon cancer. It has spread to my lungs, liver and remaining ovary. As a statistic, I am grim.I was paralyzed from shock after hearing this news, in a constant state of tears. I thought about my baby, who needs his mother. I thought about all of the milestones I have witnessed in his short life, and the many more which lie ahead. I thought about our delightful, ordinary days.  Seeing his eyes light up at cars and trucks.  His hugs. Dean’s life without me is not a thought that my husband or I can swallow. Two months into chemotherapy treatments, I am in capable hands and grateful for my doctors. But I am quite ill from the treatments, and we have quickly learned that our insurance will not cover some of the most critical aspects of my longer-term care, including many alternative and integrative therapies and experimental trials.  I am a young mother, and a short life span of suboptimal quality simply will not do. My husband is becoming an expert in my care, and I recently became a vegan under the direction a nutritionist who challenges traditional approaches to cancer and food.  I also continue to be an active mom to Dean, who is blissfully unaware. He celebrated his 2nd birthday this month amid the great excitement of his new toys and trucks. In the coming months, I need to travel nationwide to get treatment from doctors who don’t accept my insurance and receive medicine that is not covered either. I will undoubtedly need primary care from my husband, who will have to take time off without pay. The financial costs we face are staggering, but we are strong and determined.  We will not give up without a fight that will make our son proud. We are telling you our story because we need your help. If you can make a financial donation to help us, we will forever be grateful. Our son will grow up knowing the goodness in others, who gave his mother a chance to continue fighting to be here for him. If you cannot donate, please share our story, or share stories with us about people who challenge traditional boundaries in the fight against cancer. Every little bit helps.Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this."

Medical,Save Siyona fight Spinal muscular atrophy,"San Pablo, CA",376437.0,2300000.0,196,10.4K,35.8K,"Below is the story from Siyona and her family. kindly bear with us.

Our daughter Siyona took step in this world on 12th of September 2019. I still remember that day. We were very happy as i hold her in my arms. She was a healthy baby girl and i still remember her bright and big eyes staring me. We immediately fell in love with her and start thinking of her future. We thought of providing her every needs of her life- a good education and most important a better human. Everyday with her went on so fast when we realized she already turned 4 months. I then began to realize she was not able to hold her head nor turn sideways. She was breastfeeding normally and was gaining her usual weight. Some of our family members told this is normal and she will be be holding her head in few months. We believed and carried on dreaming of her bright future.

Days passed on and she was now 5 months. Still she was not holding her head. Now we were worried,so visited our doctor. Our doctor examined and did some neurological exam, few blood tests and a brain scan. Everything was normal and we were told she might be having a benign hypotonia of infancy. Just a bit physiotherapy and nothing much to worry about: I still remember my doctor words. We were happy she was alright and began her physiotherapy. Now she was 6 months, still hypotonic. We knew something was not right and again visited our doctor. Now our doctor advised us to visit a senior neurologist and we did so. I still remember that day, the saddest day of our life, the day when our dreams were shattered. The neurologist after assessing our child and looking the prior reports immediately told us she might be a having a neuromuscular disease only to be confirmed by genetic disease and most probably our child might be having the severe form of the disease. That was the day when we first heard of this disease called SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY. Blood was drawn and sent for genetic testing and we returned with heavy hearts.

I was very tensed and started looking after it in internet. I was told about it a bit by my neurologist. It is a progressive neuromuscular disease that gradual weakens the muscles of limbs,swallowing and breathing. You can imagine the outcome. My child can’t sit up nor walk stand, she will not be able to eat and drink and finally not able to breathe on her own. Without timely treatment most of infants with severe form of SMA will be on permanent ventilation within a year of life and rarely survive beyond two years. I was always praying to god that our reports will be negative but i was wrong. Finally got the reports that showed my daughter Siyona had type 1 SMA. My neurologist told me the prognosis and gene therapy was the only cure. Gene therapy drug called Zolgensma costs nearly 2.1 million usd and we are no longer in a position to afford. We need your support to afford my daughter's treatment. I wish to see her stand and run and fulfill her dream. Please donate for my daughter and fulfill her desire to live and achieve her dream. We believe Siyona is one of the luckiest to receive Zolgensma.


UPDATE-Utilization of fund.What if?


  Lastly what is the plan if target is not met? How will the raised funds be utilised?

First of all, seeing the support of all wellwishers all around the globe, I don’t see anything why our target won’t be met. Siyona deserves life and there are so many prayers and efforts that can’t be unheard by the God.  We will achieve the target.  I am her father and I have seen her suffering everyday and if any mishap happens or funds couldn’t be raised, then the funds will be utilised only for the palliative care of Siyona. I am a Nepal based doctor and I have seen how difficult is there for a Nepali patient to fight SMA. The remaining funds will be utilised to raise a SMA foundation in Nepal that will work entirely for the upliftment of SMA patients in Nepal including their palliative care. We are already on this process and the legal formalities are delayed by covid. We will soon update the process.



Questions:
How you are related to your beneficiary?


Hello again, I am Anish Kumar Shrestha and Siyona is my niece.Her father Dr Sandeep Shrestha is my father's sister's son.While donations are being done by the generous donors, I have to regularly withdraw the amount.

Bebeğimiz doğduğunda her şey çok normaldi, ta ki 4.ayına kadar… Hareketlerinin giderek yavaşladığını fark edip hastaneye gittiğimizde acı gerçekle yüzleştik. Oğlumuza, canımıza SMA TİP1 adı verilen genetik ve ölümcül bir kas hastalığı teşhisi konuldu. Bu hastalık kasları besleyerekhareket etmemizi sağlayan genin olmamasından kaynaklanıyor. Hastalık tedavi edilmediği takdirde ilerleyici ve ölümcül sonuçlar doğuruyor. SMN1 geninin bir mutasyon sebebi ile yok olması ve motor nöron sinir hücrelerinin bu genin ürettiği proteini alamaması sonucunda ortaya çıkan bu hastalık,tüm dünyada bebek ölümlerine yol açan genetik geçişli hastalıklar arasında ilk sırada gelmektedir. Yürüme, nefes alma, yutkunma, konuşma gibi hayati önem taşıyan sistemleri yok etmektedir. Bu hastalığın 4 tipi vardır ve en ağır türü olan 1.TİP hastalar bebeklik çağında (çoğunlukla 2 yaşından önce) gelişemeyen akciğer kapasiteleri nedeni ile yaşamlarını kaybediyorlar. Bu hastalığın tek çaresi ise Amerika’da tek doz uygulama ile tedavi edici özellikli Zolgensma adlı gen tedavisidir. Bu gen tedavisi SMA hastalığının kök sebebini çözebiliyor.

Medical,Cure Kinley & Kennedy (via Cure GM1 Foundation),"Wheat Ridge, CO",271305.0,2000000.0,153,3.1K,8.4K,"“Two of your children have a fatal, untreatable disease - they are dying”  That is the news we received for two of our beautiful daughters, Kinley (7) and Kennedy (4), the morning after our third daughter, Kieran, was born.   Without warning, we were faced with the sobering realization that our baby girls are dying.  Before this disease takes them, Kinley and Kennedy will very slowly lose their ability to walk, talk, eat…and even smile.We have been on a 4 year journey trying to understand what might be causing the developmental delays Kinley has been experiencing.  After countless appointments and evaluations with specialists from nearly every medical field, we finally received our answer on June 5th 2020 - the one we never saw coming. A full genetic screening revealed that not only Kinley, but her younger sister Kennedy both have an extremely rare genetic disorder called GM1 Gangliosidosis.  We are forever thankful that baby Kieran is not affected by this wretched disease. Currently, there is no approved treatment or cure for GM1, and it is always fatal in children.********OUR NEW REALITYGM1 Gangliosidosis is an aggressive disease where the body does not produce adequate enzymes to break down certain molecules. Instead, these molecules collect on the brain and spinal cord, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. The list of complications that our girls face is truly terrifying and the idea of watching them slowly fade away is our worst nightmare. Right now, Kinley and Kennedy are in a relatively “stable” state in their disease progression.  They can still walk independently and are verbal, though both are experiencing speech issues that make them hard to understand.  Looking at them, one would never know they both face such a grave fate, but there will come a day where each of them will no longer be able to run outside with their friends, jump on their trampoline, or tell their baby sister “I love you” if no treatments are developed.   Kinley, who wants nothing more than to be a doctor, nurse, or vet so she can help other people, will eventually not be able to take care of herself independently.  Kennedy, who loves to dance and sing and dress up, will someday not be able to do her infamous twirls and leaps, or “freeze” you with her Elsa powers.Each morning, we wake to the reality that we are another day closer to that outcome.  One day, they won’t recognize their mom and dad.  One day, they won’t be able to tell us they need something, or that they love us.  One day, they will require a feeding tube.  One day,  we will lay two of our precious babies to rest.Life expectancy for the type of GM1 Kinley and Kennedy have is difficult to predict, but estimates range anywhere from mid-childhood (10-15 years old) to the early twenties.  We are hopeful that both Kinley and Kennedy have many more great years ahead of them at a quality of life that they both deserve.   There is no way to know at what point the disease will firm its grip on Kinley and Kennedy - we are in a race against time.SOME HOPE - IT'S NOT TOO LATEThere are several treatment clinical trials coming up for both substrate suppression therapy and gene therapy through drug companies, universities, and the NIH.  This Page is a mission of hope for our family and others impacted by GM1 Gangliosidosis, and provides support to ensure these trials and developments continue. We are committed to raising awareness of this horrid disease, and promoting funding for continued research and the advancement of current clinical trials that may eventually be accessible to these children, including our own.  In fact, some believe a cure is imminent - it simply needs the support and dollars to advance.  We are not naive to the fact, however, that clinical trial spots are very, very limited and are experimental, so there are never guarantees...but we do know that our girls do not need to suffer!We intend to soak in every moment with Kinley and Kennedy while they can still run, dance, sing, and just be kids.  We now know how precious each and every day is, and appreciate every time we hear the words “I love you” from them, or hear them sing lullabies to their baby sister.  While continuing to give our girls all the love we can, and show them the world as best we can, we simply must fight to find off-label treatments to slow the progression long enough for a cure to be developed.We will still show them the world, provide experiences even seasoned adults have never had, and make sure every moment they have on this earth is not taken for granted. OUR GOALDeveloping treatments in the United States is notoriously expensive.  For gene therapy specifically, it is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for a single clinical trial participant*.  We are raising $2,000,000 - the conservative estimate for both Kinley and Kennedy to participate in a gene therapy trial.  We refuse to sit idly while our babies bodies slowly betray them and we can only achieve this goal with your support.  Every dollar is immensely important, and sharing the information with your network can and will work miracles.  Reaching this goal won’t guarantee Kinley and Kennedy treatment, but it will go far in advancing the development of the cures we and families in our position so desperately desire.We all say “we will do anything for our children”.  We’re asking for you to help us in this journey so our children and other families in our position can retain hope that there is a better future for our babies.SPECIFIC WAYS TO HELP1)  If you’re in a position to do so, please consider a donation.  Every dollar counts.2)  Spread the word - share to your social networks, email the GoFundMe information to anyone you know, and be sure to ask if your company has a donation matching program!  www.curekinleyandkennedy.org 3)  AmazonSmiles - if you aren’t already supporting a charity of choice, please take a moment to update your AmazonSmiles beneficiary to Cure GM1 Foundation.  After that, shop as you normally do, and a donation will automatically be provided for each dollar spent.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202029360 4)  Forward any leads you may have to support our cause to our Facebook Page or our email address:  https://www.facebook.com/CureKinleyKennedy [email redacted] WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?Every dollar will benefit the Cure GM1 Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance the development of life-saving treatments for GM1.  The Cure GM1 Foundation is currently funding a next generation gene therapy program in collaboration with a world class research team.  The team is headed by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz at Ohio State University who works in close collaboration with Children's Nationwide Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.  Other initiatives include funding research studies to further drug development, newborn screening, and increasing overall awareness.All donations are 100% tax deductible! *“Novel Financing Approaches Are Needed to Capitalize on Life-Saving Gene Therapies∗.” The American Consumer, The American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, www.theamericanconsumer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gene-Therapy-FINAL.pdf.

Ian was admitted to the ICU at White Plains Hospital, where tests and scans identified a large mass in his brain; he was quickly scheduled for emergency surgery to remove a large percentage of the tumor.A few days later, Ian was told he has a Grade IV Glioblastoma (GBM), a rare and aggressive brain cancer, an especially shocking diagnosis for someone Ian's age.The path for treatment will require chemo, radiation, clinical trials, and professional expertise to slow the progression of this terrible disease.At the time the brain tumor was discovered, Ian was not insured and is now reliant on all available aid to face both cancer and the many hospital bills that accompany it.Ian has opened his heart and hands, gaining new loved ones and families as he worked to help others fight their battles, and now he needs our help to fight for him.We believe in Ian, and choose to believe that he will be the exception against this cancer, just as he has been the exception in so many other things throughout his life.

Medical,#HisNameIsJustinHowell,"San Marcos, TX",219364.0,250000.0,175,7.7K,13.2K,"My name is Gregory Arellano and I'm starting this GoFundMe to go to the family of Justin Howell, a fellow Texas State student who was critically injured by Austin Police during protests Sunday, May 31st

Justin was hit by a rubber bullet and has a fractured skull as well as brain damage that, according to his brother Joshua, will lead to an extensive recovery effort. 

The Austin Police Department has already admitted wrongdoing by ""accidentally"" shooting Justin instead of a protester who was close by and  allegedly threw a backpack and/or a water bottle. 

Upon dragging him to the police station as ordered by police, Justin as well as the five other protesters were fired upon by the Austin police department. 

I'm struggling to find the appropriate resources within our state to demand that the Austin police department be held accountable for this, and while I don't know Justin or his family, I do know that he could've easily been any of us. 

The following are words by Joshua over his brother's shooting by police. Please offer whatever assistance you can as we wish for speedy health, recovery, and justice for Justin. 

 

""His name is Justin Howell. And he is my little brother.As this column has argued before, if you really want to know what happened, there is no substitute for the raw, unedited video. In it, you will see five people carrying Justin’s limp body toward police headquarters, begging the officers to get him medical attention. As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds (many of which were at the protesters carrying my brother) over the course of about 30 seconds.“What the f---?” one of them yells.Exactly.Because the five people carrying Justin weren’t “begging” to get him medical attention — at least not in the typical sense. According to Chief of Police Brian Manley in a recent press briefing, the protesters “were given direction to bring [Justin] to the officers” after which the demonstrators “were fired upon with less-lethal munitions as they brought [Justin] towards the officers to get him medical help.”Think about that. It’s unclear whether the officers who shot at the protesters were the same ones who gave them the order to approach. But at minimum, it takes a special kind of incompetence to fire at those who are doing as the police tell them. At minimum, it shows a complete inability to be aware of your surroundings and to manage the situation appropriately.There is no better evidence that here in Austin, Texas, the police are entirely out of their depth.I confirmed Manley’s account with a man named David Frost over Twitter. He was the one who filmed the aforementioned video, and he was able to provide me with another picture of my brother shortly after being hit. In the photo, his body is splayed upon the ground. Onlookers are rushing to his side.In our brief interview, Frost told me that “other protesters were throwing rocks, water bottles, and a backpack. [Justin] was not. The chief of police even said on Facebook live today. They shot the WRONG person.” Indeed, Manley did admit as much during his briefing. But it’s worth considering that this is the world in which we live: If the police tell you something, it’s best to get a second source to confirm its accuracy.It’s also notable in his briefing how little effort Manley puts into taking responsibility for what happened. No, reader, I haven’t omitted the part of Manley’s statement where he seems contrite. There was no apology. Instead, he sat at his desk for three full minutes, gave us the details above and at no point apologized to my brother, my family or the five brave protesters who carried Justin to police headquarters under fire. (To those protesters: My family sees you, and we thank you.)And what is somehow worse, Manley concludes his remarks by saying: “We are praying for this young man and his family and we are hoping that his condition improves quickly. ”To which my family, a deeply religious one, says this: We aren’t interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.And responsible you are. Because Justin won’t be improving quickly. “It will be a marathon, not a sprint,” according to one of his doctors.He has a fractured skull. He has brain damage. Doctors anticipate that when he wakes up, he will have difficulty telling his left from his right.These “less-lethal” munitions are only “less-lethal” by technicality. My brother’s condition shows what can happen when you fire them into a crowd.Earlier this week, the Austin-American Statesman reported that the Austin City Council “will hold an emergency hearing [on Thursday] to address concerns about officer’s response to racial justice protests over the weekend and to address what they see as little cooperation from Austin police leadership to transform policies.”We shall see if anything comes of it. Expect suggestions in a later column.""

He is a loving husband to his wife, Laura, and devoted father to his 7-year old daughter Katherine. Jeff is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet, who always goes out of his way to help others first.A few months ago, Jeff was diagnosed with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a fast acting cancer that grows in the liver and the spleen and causes unbearably high fevers. He has been relentlessly fighting this horrible disease, but unfortunately the cancer has become resistant to the chemotherapy. His family has consulted with some of the top doctors in Seattle, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) hospital is recommending a treatment that will help extend Jeff’s life and hopefully ease some of his symptoms.Jeff’s biggest desire and wish is to spend as much time with his family as he can. Since Jeff won’t be able to work full time and Laura will have her hands full helping Jeff and taking care of Katherine, this fundraiser is to help cover living expenses for Jeff, Laura and Katherine as they make an abrupt move to lovely, but expensive Seattle, as well as ease the family’s financial burdens in the months to come, especially with all the medical bills.Please consider making a donation to this beautiful family.

She had been scheduled for surgery two weeks after. This past Sunday June 14, 2020,  days before her surgery, ""Juju"" , how we affectionally call her, had to be rushed to the ER with severe pain. While at the ER, further tests were done to find the cause of her pain, and to everyone's unpleasant surprise it was found that her cancer had spread to her liver and lungs.  Giulianna is beautiful woman who had a successful career in modeling and desired a family with kids more than anything.  She became a mother at an early age and later in life, in recent years, she had two more beautiful children. After a series of life events, Juju ended up having to raise her three kids by herself.  In spite of her situation, she assumed her challenge as a new single mom of three with strength, grace, and love. Giulianna considers her kids as her greatest achievement and biggest blessings; these are Cedric (17), Gianna (3), and Cruz (1). Juju is a natural nurturer, a dedicated mother, a loyal friend, with a happy and very sweet personality... we often say, she ""doesn't have a bad bone in her body""! Guiliana's source of strength through all her challenges has been grounded in her strong belief in Jesus as her Lord and Savior and now her Healer. Giulianna's situation is aggravated due to the fact that she does not receive any financial help and had to stop working to continue raising her youngest children. We, Army4Juju would appreciate your donation to provide relief to her and her children with her  needs such as medical bills, childcare, rent, groceries, and special holistic nutrition for cancer. Thank you for your contribution and may God bless you for your generosity.MAMA SOLTERA DE 3 ESTA COMBATIENDO UN CANCER MUY AGRESIVO.Nuestra amiga Giuliana fue diagnosticada Con cáncer de colon a principio del mes de junio del 2020. Se le fue programada una cirugía dos semanas después de su día de diagnóstico. Este pasado domingo, 14 de junio, Días antes de su cirugía, “Juju”, Como cariñosamente le llamamos, fue ingresada de emergencia por un fuerte dolor que conllevó a ciertos estudios que arrojaron como resultado una metástasis de su cáncer a su hígado y pulmones; cosa que nos ha tomado por sorpresa a todos, incluyendo a ella y a sus nenes. Giulianna es una hermosa mujer peruana americana con una previa y muy exitosa carrera como modelo, quien deseaba siempre tener una familia e hijos más que nada. Ella se convirtió en madre a una temprana edad, y más tarde en su vida,  hace unos pocos años, tuvo dos hermosos bebes más.

Medical,Gregg Garfield Covid 19 Patient Zero,"Los Altos, CA",207768.0,50000.0,213,1.2K,5.6K,"When my brother Gregg left on Feb. 20 for his annual boys' ski trip adventure, he had no idea 10 days later he would begin his most difficult journey to date- fighting for his life.  On March 5, 2020 Gregg checked himself into St. Joseph's Providence Hospital Burbank with serious Covid-19 symptoms.  He was the hospital's first Covid-19 patient, or ""Patient Zero"" as they call him.  Two days later, under heavy sedation and paralytic drugs, the doctors intubated him- around day 10 doing a tracheostomy- and he continued to be on a ventilator for 31 days.    During that time his body became septic; his kidneys failed and he was put on CRRT dialysis; his blood pressure plummeted and he needed medications to divert his blood-flow to his major organs for survival, leaving his hands and feet starving for circulation; he spiked fevers and was covered in ice; his lungs collapsed 4 times and chest tubes were inserted; and he developed secondary infections that are common in hospital environments.  He had a 1% chance of surviving.  The doctors and nursing staff had to always remain 3 steps ahead of any potential disasters because to enter his room took about 15 minutes for them to gear up in their hazmat attire.  Gregg knocked on death's door, but said ""F#$% NO!  I'm not coming in!!!Throughout this time his ""village"" prayed for him, toasted him nightly with tequila- his favorite, meditated, danced and supported him in unmeasurable ways.  His care team at the hospital- an incredible group of smart, talented, caring individuals- did everything in their power to bring him through.  THANK YOU seems inadequate a word to express the gratitude that Gregg and his family feel for all of you. Gregg moved to acute rehab on April 24 (hospital day 50) and now begins the very long process of rebuilding his body.  He's relearning how to walk, perform daily activities, and rebuilding his strength so that he can head back home to AJ, Bear, family and friends.   Until now we have focused our communications on Gregg living and surviving this deadly virus and did not share the severity of injury to his hands and toes.  The sustained lack of circulation to his extremities caused his fingers and toes to turn black, similar to a frostbite injury.  This caused permanent damage and unfortunately once he is released from acute rehab, he will be looking at additional surgeries for amputation, prostheses and of course more physical/occupational therapy as he learns to navigate this new world.  For someone as active as Gregg, this of course is life-changing, but with the right doctors, equipment and support, we know he will tackle this next challenge- AND he will be back skiing, enjoying tequila, and causing his usual raucous-  thanks to your generosity and spirit!  In the meantime, he'll need upgrades in his house to accommodate his new hands and help facilitate movement.  He'll also need 24-hour assistance in the beginning. I know we are all struggling during this time, but these home renovations, doctors' bills, etc. add up, so any additional financial support to ease the future financial strain is more than greatly appreciated."
Medical,Help Lily Beat Cancer,"Los Angeles, CA",201455.0,200000.0,204,1.5K,7.6K,"This fundraiser has been established for my lifelong friend Ramela’s 11-year-old daughter, Lily Abbamontian. Lily is a fun-loving 6th grader who enjoys reading, building legos, watching movies and solving riddles. Most of all, however, Lily loves spending time with her parents, Ramela and Jimmy, and her two sisters, Grace (13) and Ella (8). On April 15th, Lily was rushed to Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles with an unrelenting high fever and abdominal pains. Sadly, doctors found a 7 inch mass on her right kidney, with masses in her lungs and lymph nodes. Shortly thereafter, Lily was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare and aggressive cancer requiring immediate and intense chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Unfortunately, cancer is a word that Lily is very familiar with. In 2011, Lily's maternal grandfather died of breast cancer (sadly, breast cancer occurs in men too). Two years later, Lily's mother, Ramela, courageously fought her own breast cancer battle at the age of 37, while caring for her three young daughters.  And only 3 months after Ramela's last chemo treatment, Lily's grandmother (Ramela's mother) was diagnosed with breast cancer.  There truly are no words to describe how much Lily's family has endured and now this...Lily’s parents are college sweethearts and were married shortly after Jimmy returned from his tour of duty in Iraq. Ramela teaches Art History at Pierce College and Jimmy is a high-school teacher at Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School.  As you can imagine, this catastrophic event has turned their world upside down. The family is now faced with additional financial burdens and medical treatments not covered by insurance.  As Lily embarks on the fight of her life, her road to recovery will be long.  Unable to attend school, Lily will be spending much of the upcoming year in and out of the hospital.  This fundraiser has been established to help ease the burden on Lily's parents, so that the family can focus all their efforts on Lily’s treatment, healing and spending precious time together.  Anyone who knows Ramela and Jimmy can attest to the fact that they are incredibly giving when it comes to their time, love, and energy for anyone in need.  As the Abbamontians face the unthinkable and do all they can to help Lily beat cancer, if we can help alleviate some of the day to day financial pressures that will mount during this time of critical care, we too will have done our part to support them in a time of sincere need. #HelpLilyBeatCancerWith much gratitude,

Medical,Help Adeline Conquer COVID,"La Fayette, NY",197570.0,150000.0,107,3.8K,19.5K,"Adeline, an OB/GYN resident physician, was starting her second year of residency in Texas when she got sick. On July 8th Adeline went into work for her 12 hour shift in the ER. While she mostly works delivering babies, she was doing a rotation in the ER, treating COVID patients. That morning she went into work feeling well and excited to see patients, but by the evening she began to feel under the weather. What started as intense flu-like symptoms escalated within the week to a hospital stay. Adeline spent the next few weeks battling COVID and was treated with several different respiratory therapies and put on dozens of drugs. When there was no positive response to these methods of treatment Adeline decided to begin an experimental drug trial. However, before we could see if this new drug was effective, her lungs could no longer support her. On August 3rd Adeline was intubated and placed on a ventilator. That night her vitals were unstable and the doctors said that she was not responding well to the ventilator. After consulting with our parents, the doctors took the last remaining step available. At 1am on August 4th Adeline was placed on ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The catheters used in the ECMO machine involved an invasive procedure to place them in her femoral artery. The ventilator opens her lungs through positive pressure, while the ECMO machine oxygenates her blood. This leaves Adeline’s lungs with the only task of healing themselves. It is projected that Adeline will be on the ventilator and ECMO for at least 6-8 weeks. Since we are from Syracuse, NY, our parents have had to travel back and forth to be there for Adeline and continue to support our family. While our Dad’s job can be done virtually, our Mom’s cannot and therefore she cannot work. In addition, our Mom helps to take care of our 91 year old grandmother, the responsibility of which has now fallen on us. When Adeline gets off life support, she will need physical, respiratory, and occupational therapy to regain her strength and mobility. At this time, we do not know how long a full recovery will take or when she will be able to return to work.Donations made to Adeline’s cause will go toward medical expenses, her bills, travel expenses, and to support the family while we navigate this difficult time.We want everyone to know that Adeline is a fighter. She is determined and has set her mind to surviving this virus. As she fights everyday for her life, we need to stay strong for her on the home front. So much love and support has been shown to our family and from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you.Addendum: Maureen Fagan, the organizer of this GoFundMe, is Dr. Adeline Fagan's sister. Any funds withdrawn from this GoFundMe will be deposited into Adeline's account and will be used accordingly for the purposes stated above."
Medical,Colvin Family Recovery,"Nashville, TN",190526.0,200000.0,165,1.1K,1.7K,"If you're reading this, then you're probably aware of the tragedy that befell my family on the afternoon of Sunday, May 3rd. If not---the short story is that my husband (Jeff) and son (Judge) came within an inch of their lives when they were crushed by a 75 foot red oak tree that fell during a storm in Nashville. Three year old Judge suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and was in a coma for two weeks, all the while being closely and carefully monitored by the heroes at Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. Because neither our hometown of Nashville, nor the State of Tennessee offers inpatient rehabilitation for children with brain injuries, Vanderbilt transferred Judge to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA), where we have been since May 27th. Jeff shattered 19 ribs, both of his scapulas, punctured a lung, and grotesquely broke his back (sorry, but that's how it was described to us), requiring spinal surgery to both fuse his broken vertebrae and to insert a steel rod. It's nothing short of a miracle that both survived their injuries, and in Jeff's case, is able to use his legs. Because of the global pandemic, cruelly, neither Jeff nor Judge have been allowed visitors during their hospital stays. I've been living with Judge and, mercifully, both hospitals have made a couple of exceptions along the way, so that Jeff could see Judge and I for a short time...but our family having to be apart over the last six weeks with no other visitors has been very tough for us to endure emotionally. Thankfully, Jeff has since moved on to outpatient status and is doing his rehabilitation work at the renowned Shepherd Center in Atlanta, while staying in an apartment nearby the facility. We're incredibly grateful that both Jeff and Judge were able to transfer to two of the top facilities in the country to undergo their rehab work. Once Judge is discharged from CHOA and is ready to begin his outpatient work, we have rented a home where the three of us will finally reunite as a family. What a happy day that will be! Jeff & Judge's doctors have been straight-forward in stressing the long-term therapy and care both will require. We don't know yet how Judge's young brain will heal but doctors have warned us that he may have life-long complications from the severity of his injuries. But we pray for a complete healing everyday, and we are certain that our family (extended to include you) is still living through an active, fluid, and dynamic miracle, that our precious Judge will recover fully, and will live a full and rich life, forever to be known as the boy that took on a majestic red oak, and lived to tell about it! In the few moments Jeff and I have been afforded alone, we've begun to get an understanding of the fallout from this tragedy, both in terms of financial expenses and disruption to our professional lives. We're absorbing the sobering reality that the cost of this unexpected event outstretches the resources we have available. This has been a humbling exercise, and one that has required us to face our hubris, and drop our pride for the good of our family, especially for Judge. We're heeding the advice given by our brother Thad  Cockrell from one of his most inspired songs; ""Pride won't get us where we're going"". Where we're going is home, in every sense of that word...and we need your help in getting there. It takes all the courage we can muster to ask for your assistance, even while knowing that many of you have already offered and many more are willing. It's overwhelming to consider the encouragement, love and support we've already received, and we're awestruck by the grace and generosity provided us daily, both in ways we see, and in ways unseen but felt.   Please know that once we're to the other side of this, a ""Healthy Family Together Again"", and back on firm footing, both physically and financially, we'll repay the charity given us to the life-saving, care-giving, soul-enriching healthcare providers who have nurtured Judge back to good heath, sound mind and strong spirit. We'll forever think of you as we support Monroe Carroll, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, as well as CHOA. Your gifts will be paid forward, but our family will be forever indebted to the angels who, we believe, appeared to us even as that tree began to fall, and will stay with us for time eternity."

Medical,Atlas Family,"Waxhaw, NC",183821.0,225000.0,122,1.4K,2.5K,"Last October, Jeff Atlas was diagnosed with stage three, high risk multiple myeloma, which is an incurable bone marrow cancer that attacks your blood plasma and that has resulted, for him, in full renal failure. 85% of patients with multiple myeloma are considered low risk, unfortunately Jeff is among the roughly 15% who are considered high risk due to chromosomal characteristics. This means that Jeff's particular cancer is more difficult to treat and keep under control, as it frequently finds a way to outsmart and become resistant to the treatments. For our friend Jeff, the last 9 months have been a continuous battle, where each new treatment offers a limited reprieve before his cancerous cells multiply and regain strength. Since last October, Jeff has endured a rigorous schedule of dialysis three times a week, chemotherapy treatments a minimum of three times per week, as well as multiple lengthy inpatient hospitalizations. It has been an unrelenting and exhausting battle.Jeff is a self employed clinical psychologist who has dedicated his professional career to helping others. It is now Jeff who is in need of our help. Due to the demand of his therapies, Jeff has been unable to work since last September. Jeff and his wife Leisa have three children, Katie (22) rising senior in college, Kyle (19) rising junior in college, and Jake (17) rising senior in high school. Jeff is the sole source of income for their family.  Though their privacy must be respected, it’s worth noting that with three kids in school, they are selling their home in an effort to continue providing for Jeff’s health care, pay bills, and to support their childrens’ educational wellbeing. They remain in a precarious financial situation with no easy solution.I think it is clear to anyone who knows the Atlases that Jeff is kind, warm, and compassionate, and there’s nothing he wouldn’t do for his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa along with their children have been a staple of the Marvin community for as long as they’ve lived here, always welcoming and essential to so many of our lives. Jeff and Leisa would be making this Go Fund Me for any of us if we were in this situation, so I’m writing to ask that you donate any amount—however small or large—so that the emotional and physical stress of Jeff’s illness won’t be further compounded by financial concerns.**Jeff and Leisa welcome spiritual support in whatever form that may be. Jeff is currently undergoing rigorous preparations for a tandem stem cell transplant in the beginning of August, which if successful, could offer him more precious time with his family and friends. Jeff and Leisa greatly appreciate any well wishes you are able to offer."

Jonathan was only 1.5 and Courtney was pregnant with Alexandra. Between then and now, he has battled and fought through 3 different months-long chemotherapy treatments and 3 massive surgeries (tumor resection/fibula removal, lung lumpectomy & lung wedge resection). Through it all, he has kept working, caring for his family and kept his amazing optimistic outlook. This spring we received  the devastating news that the tumor had traveled to several organs, putting him in stage 4, metastatic. He kept fighting and tried to get on a clinical trial for one-last shot. Unfortunately, the tumors were too aggressive and nothing helped. Rob was diagnosed terminal on May 26th. To know Robbie is to love Robbie. He has a larger-than-life personality, whose  smile,  boisterous voice and laughter is only matched by the size of his heart. He is a social butterfly and makes friends with anyone that crosses his path. His love of the Ducks is the only thing that comes close to that of his love for his family and friends. He is an amazing, son, brother, husband, father and friend. The time he has here with us all is cruelly short, but the legacy of love that he is leaving will last a lifetime.  In this time, Robbie and family are doing their best to prepare, but also see all the people and things that Rob loves so much. He even made his way to his beloved Autzen stadium one last time.  Rob is now at home in hospice and we are doing our best to keep him comfortable, pain-free, with lots of love from family and friends in the time he has left. The family has been offered a ton of help, but Courtney will need to sort out how to manage everything after Rob passes.  We want to  raise money so Robbie's time left can be spent focusing on spending time with his friends and family and not worrying about finances. The best way to help is through this Gofundme. The different costs that will need to be managed - funeral expenses, childcare, meal delivery services, future children expenses and a college fund for Jonny and Peach.

My Leukemia diagnoses was something I was a little nervous to share but it felt odd to keep it away from a community that I feel so close to. 

I was also hesitant to make a gofundme because I have no idea how much this hospital stay or subsequent medical care will but its been encouraging to hear from so many of you encouraging me to do so. Prior to this, I considered my self a pretty healthy person so picking a robust insurance plan as always been more of a second thought (*regrets*). So the goal I set is really just a random guess. 

Whatever is amount donated will go towards medical expenses and keeping things running with the nurselifern media company as I take some time off over the next few weeks or months to recuperate. I appreciate you guys.

Medical,"Scott ""Scooter"" Ward Recovery","Birmingham, AL",166693.0,200000.0,119,1.1K,5.3K,"Scooter’s Recovery- First of all, you need to know that Scooter wouldn’t want me to do this. It’s going to make him feel so uncomfortable, but with all sincerity, I know he would do it for me.My best friend and roommate in college Scott Ward, affectionately called “Scooter” (a childhood nickname, not because he uses a wheelchair) by most who know him, is a sports psychologist by trade. More importantly, he is a son, a brother, a husband, a counselor to college students, a coworker, a friend. Scooter is also a SURVIVOR!In 1986 as a freshman in college, he survived a freak diving accident on an obstacle course that caused a high (C4/5) but incomplete injury to his spinal cord. Doctors at first gave him little chance for survival, then gave him little chance for independent breathing or voluntary movement below his shoulders, then gave him little chance for living a full, active life.With the expertise of therapists, the support of family and friends, but mostly with his own initiative and resourcefulness, he effectively relearned so much of life—how to move, to eat, to write, to transfer from his wheelchair to his car and back again, to drive, to focus, to work. He graduated from college, then went on to earn a master’s degree and doctoral degree. I first met Scooter while I was an undergraduate on the track team and he was finishing up his doctorate in Sports Psychology. It did not take long for Scooter to make me feel like we had known each other for years (anybody who has met him knows exactly what I’m talking about). I made it a point to stop by his office anytime I could because he would project so much positive energy it was impossible not to feel better with just a short visit.During one of my stops by his office, I asked him how his dissertation was coming along. Scooter replied in a nonchalant tone, “I wasn’t very productive last night since I flipped over backwards in my chair and couldn’t get up.” Wait…what? Having a new friend in a wheelchair comes with all sorts of questions, but this was shocking to hear. Me: So, what did you do?!?Scoot: Well, my roommate wasn’t at home and it was too late to call anybody, so I just slept on the floor until my roommate got home.This just blew my mind. It made me immediately realize just how tough and bold this guy is. Life literally flipped him over and he just got back up and kept going!I (along with many others) could tell stories all day about how much of an amazing person Scooter is. It is only appropriate that he found an equally amazing wife in Robin. They married in 2005 and have been a perfect fit ever since.Fast forward to October 2016. I will never forget the panic in Robin’s voice when she called me while driving to the hospital in Kansas City. Scooter had passed out in the shower and was unresponsive. He was being life flighted to KUMED after what was ultimately deemed an aortic dissection (a spontaneous tear in the largest blood vessel of the body). This required emergency open heart surgery and doctors had his odds of survival at less than 30%. He survived! However, just five weeks into recovery and in his final stages of rehab he suffered ANOTHER heart attack. This required another risky open heart surgery with even much lower odds of survival. Still, he survived. All of this leaves him with a heart functioning at less than 15%. Scooter never backed down and put everything he had into rehab and gaining his strength back. He went back to work much earlier than anybody had predicted. As a sports psychologist, he counsels student-athletes in all sports to sharpen their mental toughness and overcome barriers of all types. He doesn’t just “talk the talk” he “walks the walk”. This guy was born with a love and knack for helping people find their way. He counsels people to break through the doubt that gets in the way of success. He does this everyday by getting up at 5am to start the tedious tasks of showering and getting dressed to make it to the office or teach a class by 8am. He does this with a heart that is functioning at less than 15% and a major loss of muscle mass and strength. He does this with a smile on his face and still projects enough positive energy to make athletes believe they can run through brick walls. He was born for this!Unfortunately, Scooter was also born with genetic polycystic kidney disease. In 2018 the onset of the disease was sped up by the heart medication and numerous rounds of high-powered antibiotics he had been taking. This situation developed a grapefruit-sized tumor on his kidneys that was initially misdiagnosed as a pancreatic cancer. Days of waiting for testing without nutrition led to even more muscle loss and acute skin break down. Ultimately, his kidneys began to fail and doctors have added two to three dialysis treatments a week that take another 4 hours per treatment out of his day.A few weeks later, he was rushed back to the hospital to correct an extremely high level of carbon dioxide in his blood that had built up over months, likely from low heart function and decreased mobility. He survived that life-threatening episode, too, and now has to use BPAP and oxygen therapy every night.Scooter’s physicians have said that, to their knowledge, he is “an n of 1”—in other words, they know of no one else living an active, productive life with a high cervical spinal cord injury, heart disease and kidney disease. Doctors who meet Scooter for the first time are amazed by his optimism. “He looks better in real life than he does on paper,” and his life reflects that.I’m no doctor, but I could have told you over 20 years ago and I’m telling you now that Scooter is “an n of 1”. He is Superman. He literally changes people’s lives for the better every day with a body full of organs that have tried to quit on him. He is a selfless Superman.Scooter and his wife, Robin, know they are fortunate. They are surrounded by people who care and who have been with them every step of the way. They are grateful for every “bonus day” they have together. They both actively make a living, and they contribute to the community, independently and together. What they are facing now, though, despite paying for and having the best health insurance plan available to them, is a cascade of out-of-pocket health expenses that have drained their accounts and their energy. They pay the portions insurance does not pay for dialysis, BPAP and oxygen support, plus expensive dressings and supplies, and any nursing/physical help he receives at home. Since 2017 Scooter has also battled skin issues, something new to his life of 30+ years in a wheelchair. Deep ischial wounds have required two surgeries and the use of a specialty wound VAC machine. These skin issues are rough on the rump for a guy who spends all of his time in a chair. Believe it or not, these are as debilitating as anything he has dealt with. These issues require the help of Robin and others to transfer him from his bed to his chair every morning and night. He has done everything medically he can do locally and has decided to see specialists and surgeons at the Mayo Clinic to hopefully heal them for good. This final piece of the recovery puzzle could literally put him back in the driver seat and back to his strong and independent life he lived just four years ago.Next month, I will be driving him there because it’s a safer way for him to travel and because he likes my jokes. His compromised health puts him at higher risk of becoming ill if exposed to COVID-19, so surgery, follow-up care, and at least a six-week period of recovery in the Minneapolis area is in store. Scooter will be confined to a hospital bed, eight hours away from home, during a time when visitors are strictly limited. Although insurance is still very helpful, there are expenses that are not covered—tough at any time, but especially during the current economic climate. I am going to trust the expertise from the team at the Mayo Clinic to relieve the stress of his skin condition but I plan to reach out to as many as I can to help relieve the financial stress of this mission. Anything you are able to give is much appreciated. Please share his story and continue to spread the positive energy he has shared with so many.The world would be a better place if it had more people like Scooter. Seeing that he is “an n of 1” means we need to take care of the only one we have!"
Medical,Help support John Carlin as he fights ALS,"Huntington Beach, CA",178309.0,500000.0,124,797,2.1K,"John Carlin needs our help as he fights the late stages of ALS (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease). He received this difficult news in 2016, and he has been battling this disease every day since. He is not alone in this fight as his family and friends work to support John, but we are coming to a difficult time in John's battle with ALS. John is the son of Jim and Lynne, the oldest of four brothers (Patrick, Kevin and Chris), a favorite cousin to Jill, Wendy and Scott and beloved uncle to Taylor, Sean, James and Drew.The average cost of ALS for a year of treatment is approximately $250,000.  This includes the cost of a full-time caregiver, 24-hour treatment, prescription drugs and therapies, skilled nursing and medical equipment.John has spent his career in sports working for Roy Firestone and Chris Myers at ESPN, then at ""The Best Damn Sports Show Period"" at Fox (Chris Rose, Tom Arnold, Michael Irvin, John Salley, and John Kruk), and finally, as part of the team at ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" in Hollywood, CA booking sports guests and managing corporate brand integrations. Working in Hollywood can be a tough business, but John has frequently been referred to as “the nicest guy in Hollywood."" He values relationships and looks for what he can give to those he works with, rather than what he can take. This has made him a favorite with the sports guests he books.Even after his diagnosis, John thought of others suffering from ALS. His company rallied around him launching the Jimmy Kimmel ALS Charity Initiative  where the company provided celebrity experiences to fans with donations going to Project ALS , ONE2ONE USA Foundation  and the ALS Association Golden West Chapter . Even with all the press around the initiative, John asked not to be mentioned by name, making the focus about others struggling with this insidious disease.Then John partnered with Major League Baseball for their 2019 Winter Meetings  to raise money for five other ALS charities through athlete and team experiences. The day MLB held the press conference for this initiative, long-time ALS patient and advocate Pete Frates passed away from the disease, showing that even with tremendous support, the effects of the disease can be devastating.John has spent most of his life giving and helping others. Now he has mounting medical bills, needs new medical equipment and will soon have to hire a full-time caregiver. He has already lost the use of his arms and hands, and he is be unable to walk short distances.His mother Lynne and father Jim have been working tirelessly to get John to medical appointments all over the United States to get him the help he needs as he participates in various clinical trials, but at their advancing age it is becoming a challenge. John needs our help as costs to give him the care he needs are exhausting the family's savings. Thank you so much for giving what you can to help us ease his stress so he can focus on continuing to fight ALS.Much love to you all!The Carlin Family"
Medical,Help Coach Steve Parker Get Back in the Game,"Chevy Chase, MD",163750.0,150000.0,195,1.2K,1.7K,"On March 30, our friend Steve Parker played tennis with his brother Collin.  It was a day much like any other for Steve at a time when the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic had made so many things far from normal.  After saying goodbye to Steve, Collin would not speak to him for another seven days.  In fact, no one would see or speak with Steve between March 30 and April 6.   Steve returned home after hitting with Collin, and then, things took a terrible turn.  Steve was in his apartment, where he lives alone, when he suffered a massive middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. No one knows when the stroke occurred, but his phone indicates that Steve failed to respond to calls and texts between April 1 and April 6.  Growing concerned that Steve had not responded to them in several days, Collin and his brother David went to Steve’s apartment.  There, they found him collapsed, disoriented, and confused.  Steve was rushed by ambulance to the hospital. Many of you know Steve through tennis.  He has touched the lives of innumerable people who have attended his clinics, taken lessons, or watched him teach their children.  Steve has been a USPTA pro for 34 years and has been a fixture in the greater Washington, D.C. tennis community for decades.  Steve is a teacher, coach, and mentor to tennis players of every age and skill level, and he is a friend to all. To spend an hour on the tennis court with Steve is to know him a lifetime.  Students come to Steve to learn a game, and they leave with a lifelong friend.  No matter if you are Steve’s first lesson of the day or his last after many hours on the court, Steve meets you with a big smile and genuine interest in you and your family.  Anyone who has played on a court anywhere close to Steve has heard his billowing laugh.  It is as infectious as it is genuine. Steve enjoys the game of tennis, but his real love is teaching, especially children.  Countless players owe their college and high school tennis careers to Steve and even more look back fondly to spending hours learning from him.  Ask any of them, and they will say that they are proud to be members of Team Parker. A stroke causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain.  In an MCA stroke, blood flow supplied by the middle cerebral artery, the largest artery in the brain, is cutoff (an infarction) by an ischemia (a blockage, clot, or constriction).  As with any stroke, rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to limiting damage.  While no one knows exactly how long Steve waited to be found, it is clear that he was alone and suffering for several days as he lost valuable time for treatment.  Most weeks, Steve teaches tennis seven days per week.  The courts at which he teaches were closed to comply with coranavirus distancing measures.  Had Steve been teaching on his normal schedule, he very likely would have been found much earlier. Doctors initially determined that Steve had lost the use of his right side and his ability to speak.  The degree to which he was cognitively impaired was unknown.  After being treated for seven days in the hospital, Steve was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation center where he remains today.  Coranavirus precautions have made it impossible for Steve to have any visitors in either facility.    All of Steve’s students know he will work tirelessly to rehabilitate.  He will push himself the way he has inspired so many of his students to work and grow.  While Steve is beginning to try to vocalize and can take a few steps with the assistance of his therapist and a wide base quad cane, he has a long journey ahead of him.  Unfortunately, there are no set timelines for recovery, and Steve faces the very real possibility that he will never regain full use of his body.  Steve’s immediate goals focus on regaining some of his ability to communicate and use his right arm and leg.  Success will be measured by the degree to which Steve will be able to function independently.   At this point, it is hard to envision Steve returning to the tennis court, the place where he has earned his living for over 30 years.  Coaches and instructors like Steve do not choose their profession for the money.  It is a calling.  It is also a profession that only pays when you work. Our campaign goal is $150,000.  This will be used to assist Steve with the following expenses: ·      Medical and hospital bills·      Rehabilitation bills·      Durable medical equipment and ambulatory devices·      Continued physical, occupational, and speech therapy·      Home health assistance·      Living expenses Thank you for reading Steve’s story.  In these days of the Coronavirus pandemic, we are witnessing suffering of every type, and many people are in need.  If you know Steve, please consider his selfless nature and the countless hours he has devoted to people like you and the many children who fondly call him Coach Steve.  If you do not, please consider helping a truly generous person who now must rely on others’ generosity.  We appreciate any help, no matter how large or small.  Please help us get the word out by sharing our campaign on social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) and with your friends.  We will update this page on Steve’s progress and the use of funds. If you have any questions, please contact [email redacted]. #HelpCoachSteve #CoachSteve #JoinTeamParker Frequently Asked Questions 1.   Who are you and why are you starting the Help Get Coach Steve Parker Back in the Game Campaign?The Help Get Coach Steve Parker Back in the Game campaign was established by Gary Kessler and Collin Parker.  Gary and his daughter are among Steve’s many students.  Like so many of his students, they greatly value Steve’s teaching and friendship and are proud members of Team Parker.  Collin Parker is Steve’s younger brother.  Gary and Collin established this campaign to assist Steve with the expenses associated with his treatment and rehabilitation as well as his lost income.   2.   Who will administer the funds raised by the campaign?Steve’s brother Collin Parker will hold and administer all funds raised by the campaign until Steve is able to attend to his personal affairs. 3.  Does Steve have health and disability insurance?Unfortunately, Steve held neither health nor disability insurance at the time he suffered his stroke.  His brother Collin Parker has applied for Medicaid on Steve’s behalf to assist Steve with future medical expenses. 4.  Was Steve’s stroke caused by COVID-19 (coronavirus)?We do not know.  Steve was not tested for coronavirus during his stay at the hospital.  At the time, it was not widely understood that a stroke could be caused by the COVID-19 virus.  Although Steve later tested negative for active virus at the rehabilitation center, he has not undergone an antibody test to determine if he previously had the virus that causes COVID-19.  5.   How is Steve progressing?Steve is receiving inpatient occupational, physical, and speech therapy at a rehabilitation center.  Steve is beginning to try to vocalize and can take a few steps with the assistance of his therapist and a wide base quad cane.  Steve currently has nominal use of his right arm. 6.     What care will Steve receive when he is able to return home?  Who will care for him?Steve lived alone at the time he suffered his stroke.  After he is discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation center, Steve will move to his brother Collin Parker’s house.  Steve will still require ongoing occupational, physical, and speech therapy as well as the assistance of a home health aide to perform self-care and home management activities.  Collin and his wife will help Steve while attending to their young family and professional obligations."
Medical,Help Faye beat Leukemia,"Spokane, WA",163875.0,150000.0,72,846,2K,"Faye has Leukemia.Faye Prekeges is a smart, empathetic, funny, fun, hardworking, no BS girl. A bit outspoken like her dad! She speaks French, loves to travel, read, listen to music, write poetry and swim. She spent 8 weeks in France as an exchange student when she was a sophomore in high school and worked at a refugee camp in Greece for 2 weeks when she was a senior. She also worked on her school’s newspaper and wrote articles for one of her local Idaho newspapers. She was captain of the swim team junior year and spent summers working for her dad at Grumpy’s. After graduation and acceptance to Northeastern University’s international start program she left for Sydney Australia in July of 2019 for her first semester of college. Sadly, things changed when Faye was back in Boston for her second semester. In February of 2020, Faye thinking she had the flu took an Uber to Boston Medical Center because she had been sick for several days and her fever was 104 degrees. Instead of the flu, she was diagnosed with mono. The doctors running tests were concerned about her blood counts so admitted her for further testing. Her mom came to Boston and upon arrival they were told she has leukemia. After a bone marrow biopsy, she was specifically diagnosed with high-risk B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Faye began treatment in Boston and was transferred to Seattle Children’s Hospital at the end of March. After 3 months of intense chemotherapy Faye was given the news she would need a bone marrow transplant. She had a small population of leukemia cells that were resistant to the chemo she had been given. This was her best chance for long term survival. In addition, she was told that she would be infertile due to the full body irradiation and high dose chemo she would receive prior to transplant. WOW…what a change in this young ladies life. Faye is strong and a fighter so she decided bone marrow transplant it is! In addition, she chose to have an ovary removed for a chance of fertility preservation. This is new science and Faye was the first person to have it done at Seattle Children’s. Her ovary was transferred overnight to Pittsburgh where it was processed and frozen and will end up in Minnesota for long term storage. In the meantime, a house has been rented for a year in Seattle close to the hospital. Pete is driving back and forth to Idaho to run both business during a pandemic. Restaurants and bars aren’t the best line of work to be in right now but if you know Pete he is making it happen! Molly has stopped working to be Faye’s caregiver and neither she nor Faye have been home since Faye’s diagnosis. George is beginning his senior year of college and hoping he will not get sent home to work online again!  Because Faye’s immune system will be like that of a newborn baby she was told not to work or attend school in person for a year. Faye loves to learn so her goal is to begin classes online in the spring and eventually attend the University of Washington full time. Even though she took a medical leave of absence and eventually withdrew from Northeastern she has not stopped learning. She watches you tube videos that college professors have posted of classes that interest her. She watches tv shows in Norwegian to help her learn another “easy” language. Her French teacher from high school has sent her books in French and gave her a list of others to read. She is an amazing young lady! The funds raised are to help with medical costs not covered by insurance and costs associated with the transplant process…rental apartment in Boston, bills from Boston Medical Center and Boston Children’s, rental house in Seattle, lost tuition at Northeastern, fertility preservation surgery (not covered by insurance), long term health care. There is a caring bridge set up to follow her progress if you wish to./https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/fayeprekeges In lieu of funds, especially with a pandemic hitting us all hard in our economy, we ask that you register as a bone marrow donor, so in the future you to may be able to save a life. bethematch.org"

En el mes de mayo que tenía su quinta dosis de gammaglobulina, se observó que la cuenta de linfocitos bajaron mucho, sin embargo, se sentía perfectamente bien, después de dos semanas comenzó con una fiebre muy rara de cada 24 horas, fue ingresado al hospital por ser un paciente  de alto riesgo de covid19, al ingresar en el hospital le realizaron una series de estudios y exámenes donde incluyen rayos X, exámenes de sangre, entre otros y en una tomografía computarizada, sale la presencia de  varios nódulos, cosa que alertó a los médico y éstos decidieron hacerle una punción en el pulmón. El diagnóstico que dieron en México fue de un linfoma no Hodgkin de células B grandes difusas con presencia del virus de Epstein-Barr, sin embargo, los padres decidieron tener una segunda opinión que confirmaran este diagnóstico y es cuando les aconsejaron ir a Houston ya que ésta es la ciudad con más expertos en oncología, inicialmente contaban con un seguro de gastos médicos sin embargo este no dio cobertura. Después de realizar numerosos estudios se pudo llegar a un diagnóstico definitivo y es el de Granulomatosis Linfomatoide.La Granulomatosis Linfomatoide es una enfermedad poco frecuente, que entra en las llamadas ¨enfermedades raras¨ relacionada con los linfomas que se define como un proceso linfoproliferativo de células B, angiodestructivo, que se asocia con infección por el virus de Epstein-Barr. El órgano afectado con más frecuencia es el pulmón donde pueden observarse múltiples nódulos provocando insuficiencia respiratoria y disnea. al ser un proceso multi orgánico puede presentarse en órganos tales como: piel, sistema nervioso, tracto gastrointestinal, hígado, bazo, riñón y corazón. La afectación cerebral puede provocar entre otros síntomas convulsiones y suele existir aumento del tamaño del bazo. El proceso tiende a evolucionar a un linfoma maligno, si no se trata a tiempo. Es por esto que debemos actuar cuanto antes.Esta enfermedad poco común se ha visto presentada en personas de edad avanzada por lo que lo hace más rara que se presente en edad joven como la de Moisés. El equipo oncológico del Texas Children´s Hospital, sugiere y recomienda que Moisés sea referido a Maryland donde se encuentra un equipo médico con experiencia en este diagnóstico. Ciclos de quimioterapias y otras drogas son parte del tratamiento, y se tiene un tiempo estimado de 9 a 12 meses de tratamientoTodo este proceso ha sido muy costoso y lo seguirá siendo, actualmente su familia no cuenta con el dinero para llevarlo a cabo,  es por esto que sus amigos hemos decidido abrir esta campaña para recaudar los fondos necesarios lo antes posible y así poder sufragar los gastos que esta situación implica.¡Espero que Moi y su familia puedan contar con tu ayuda! 
----------- Moisés Yahir Benitah Luna (known to all as Moy) is a young Venezuelan who went to live in Mexico 6 years ago with his family, Moises is the eldest son of Youlyn and Elias Benitah, he has 2 sisters, a 13 year old and one of 9 years old, currently Moses is 18 years old.Moses was diagnosed last December with severe combined primary immunodeficiency TB-NK +, Moses must receive gamma globulin every 28 days. In the month of May when he had his fifth dose of gamma globulin, it was observed that the lymphocyte count dropped a lot, however, he felt perfectly well, after two weeks he started with a very rare fever every 24 hours, he was admitted to the hospital for being a high-risk patient for covid19. Upon entering, the hospital carried out a series of studies and exams including x-rays, blood tests, among others, then,  in a CT scan, they found the presence of several nodules, which alerted the doctors making them  decide to puncture the lung, showing a diagnose of diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus.However, Moi’s parents decided to look for a second opinion that can confirm the diagnosis, thats when they decided to travel to Houston to visit a group of oncologist.  Initially, they were counting with their health insurance to take over this expenses, unfortunately this wasn't the case.  The coverage for the studies wasn't included on the original policy.  They decided to continue forward. At the hospital, they performed multiple exams to get to the final diagnose of a “Lynphomatoid Granulomatosis”.The Lynphomatoid Granulomatosis is a rare disorder, characterized by an overproduction of white blood cells known as B lymphocytes. These B cells can build up in the tissues of the body, causing damage to the blood vessels. In many cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the abnormal B cells contain the Epstein-Barr mostly occur to males.  The organ that is mostly affected by this condition are the lungs, you may see the presence of multiple nodules causing shortness of breath and cough.  Other organs that can be affected are the skin, the nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, kidneys, and heart.  If the brain is been affected can produce convulsions, and enlargement of the spleen.  If this condition is not taken on time could develop into a malignant lymphoma. That is why we need to act fast. This extremely rare disease is mostly seen on people of advanced age, what make´s it even more rare on Moi, an 18 year old young man.  The oncology team at Texas Children’s Hospital recommended transfering Moi to a program in Maryland, where there is a group of physicians with experience in this area. Some of the recommended treatments are several rounds of chemotherapy combined with others oral and IV drugs. This will take between 9-12 month.All this process, besides the physical load, takes also financial pressure on Moi’s family, they don’t count with the money to offer his son the treatment that he needs.  This is why, we, their friends, decided to open this page to help them raise the founds they need. Hope Moi and his family can count with your help!"
Medical,Support the Frew Family❤️,"Concord, NH",159155.0,150000.0,47,881,2.3K,"As many of you know, on Tuesday October 5th 2020, Ryan Frew passed away unexpectedly of a sudden illness. Ryan Grew in up in Concord, NH.  He graduated from Concord High School in 1998 and Southern New Hampshire University in 2002.  The untimely passing of Ryan has left his family and friends shocked and heartbroken.
Many of us know Ryan through his many Accomplishments in the Hockey industry.  Ryan began working at Tri-Town Ice Arena in 2004 and was the head coach of Junior Hockey and the General Manager of the New Hampshire Junior Monarchs Organization. He was regarded in the hockey community as a leader, an innovator, an advocate, and a trailblazer. He has supported many young men on his team; guiding them as athletes, and preparing them for the next steps in their academics and professional careers.  It is evident who has been influenced by Ryan-each person to cross his path worked harder, laughed louder, and valued each moment a little more.
Ryan was a dedicated husband and a loving father. His proudest accomplishment in life was his family.  The love between Ryan and Anastasia started 20 years ago when they met at SNHU.  Their love grew stronger as they brought 3 beautiful children into the world. Quentin (10), Seasmus (9) and Layla (2) were the love of his life.  
Anastasia and the kids have a long hard road ahead of them.  Ryan would want to know that we are all there to help support them.  We are raising money to be put into a College Fund for his beautiful children.  No amount of money can replace what they have lost, but we would like to provide some financial security to help them in the future.
Thank you for holding his family in your thoughts and for any contributions to this fund."

For those of you who don’t personally know her, well she is probably one of the strongest, most positive, energetic, happy souls out there, and we know you would love her like we do. Ashlee is quite a private person, but finally has given us permission to share her current family struggle as we know that people will want to help her during this difficult time.Last week, Ashlee’s 19 year old son Michael was diagnosed with a form of T Cell Lymphoma called Hepatosplenic Lymphoma. He immediately started chemotherapy treatment at Miami Children’s hospital and they are staying positive and strong. They already know that he is in need of a Bone Marrow Transplant. This could take place as early as late September, but right now it’s a waiting game. He first needs to undergo aggressive treatment to prepare his body for that procedure. The BMT itself is a very intense long process but has great success rates and is what Michael needs.For those of you who don’t know, Ashlee is a single mom of 3, as her husband passed away from a similar form of cancer a little over 4 years ago. She is also self employed, so basically if she doesn’t teach/work, she has no income coming in, and as you can imagine her business was already affected due to Covid-19.We want to raise these funds for her so that she doesn’t concern herself with having to make a choice whether to go teach a class or stay by her son’s side during the tough days ahead. We already know that for a minimum of 5 weeks during the BMT she will not be able to work at all as she will be his caregiver during the process. At this stage she also has no idea what his insurance will cover, but it’s pretty clear there will also be additional medical bills. If we raise these funds for her, she will not have to worry about making money to put food on the table, pay rent, and tackle those bills that will start piling up.We are aware that many people are currently going through financial issues so completely  understand if you cannot donate, but even just keeping this special family in your thoughts and prayers will be very much appreciated.I ask that you please give the Cramer Family their privacy during this difficult time, but feel free to reach out to me (Vicky) if you have any questions.Thank you all and we will update you soon on Michael's progress.Organizers: Vicky Politi, Nicola Brisuela, Marie Gaschler, Kristin Douthit Richards."
Medical,Mike Barnett Recovery Fund,"Nashville, TN",158327.0,200000.0,101,1.5K,4.8K,"If you’re reading this, you likely know that Mike Barnett is one of the premier fiddle players of his generation. From his work touring with bluegrass legend Ricky Skaggs, to his Grammy-nominated solo endeavors, Mike has wowed audiences for years with his virtuosic and creative approach to the fiddle. Now, he needs our help.On Saturday, July 25th, Mike suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while at home in Nashville. Mike’s wife Annalise was with him at the time, and quickly got him to the TriStar Skyline hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery to remove the massive clot in his brain. The surgeons determined that he bled from an “arteriovenous malformation,” which he was likely born with. After several days in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit at Skyline, Annalise and his family decided to transfer him to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he underwent a second surgery to repair the AVM and reduce brain swelling, on Aug 1st. Much to the relief of his family and friends, the surgeons reported the surgery a great success. He spent another week or so in the ICU, and was released to a general hospital bed on Aug 8th, where he has since been gaining strength and making amazing strides towards regaining consciousness and motor functions on his left side. Thus ends “the thriller,” as Annalise has dubbed it, and so begins “the marathon.”Mike is going to need extensive therapy going forward. Although he shows many remarkable signs of progress, he remains unable to fully express himself in speech or written language, and has very limited mobility on the left side of his body. Everyone in Mike’s life wants him to get the best therapy possible, to maximize the likelihood that Mike could regain some quality of life, and possibly even play fiddle again. His family has painstakingly considered many options, in order to choose the rehab center most suited to his needs.Annalise and Mike’s parents have determined that his best bet is the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. Shepherd is consistently ranked one of the best in the country, and luckily enough, they have a room opening up this week. As an inpatient, Mike will receive 3-5 hours of rehab every day, which will include speech, physical, and occupational therapy. His stay will be at least 6 weeks, possibly longer. Annalise will be able to stay there with him, a huge benefit of Shepherd (many other rehab facilities aren’t even allowing visitors due to Covid), and she’ll receive emotional support in the form of therapy groups for spouses/family.As I’m sure you can imagine, Shepherd isn’t cheap. The cost of his stay will exceed both what is covered by insurance and the financial resources available to him. It is with the utmost humility and gratitude that his loved ones ask for your help. These funds will allow for Mike to get the absolute best care at this crucial time, and will go a long way to alleviate the financial burdens Annalise will face in adjusting to a new city and a new reality. With your help, it is possible to imagine a bright future for Mike and Annalise; one of good health and free of substantial medical debt.His friends and family are exceptionally grateful for the outpouring of love and support Mike has received thus far. If you can, please consider a donation to aid in the recovery of everyone’s favorite guy and truly brilliant musician, Mike Barnett."
Medical,Help Claire's Battle Against Advanced Lung Cancer,"El Paso, TX",155032.0,250000.0,109,862,3.9K,"After dedicating herself to studying medicine for four years, followed by three years of residency training in emergency medicine, Dr. Claire Wright Thomas returned home to El Paso in July 2020.  She was finally ready to begin her career and had accepted a position in one of the local Emergency Departments. Claire, her husband Steve, and their golden retriever Castro were excited to start a new chapter in their lives.  Claire was especially pleased to be so near her parents, Tom and Karen, and her brother and sister-in-law, Trey and Gabi.Almost as soon as she arrived in El Paso, she began experiencing extreme COVID 19 symptoms. After two negative test results and no sign of improvement, she was admitted to the hospital. On August 1, three weeks before she was due to start her new job, alone in hospital, she was told that she has advanced lung cancer which has spread to her liver and bones. Claire and her family are exploring the best treatment options available. Final tests are pending which will guide Claire’s treatment going forward.  Her local Oncologist (cancer doctor) would like her to be evaluated by the cancer specialists at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In addition to this devastating diagnosis, is the enormous expense that comes with an extended hospital stay and cancer treatments.  The financial stress caused by Claire’s unforeseen medical emergency has been quite daunting for the entire family.  Although insurance is helpful, there are significant expenses that will not be covered. With that in mind, our goal is to aim high and raise funds to lessen the great financial impact they are facing. This will allow every ounce of their thought and energy to go solely toward Claire’s treatment and battle with cancer.We do not want Claire and Steve; her parents, Tom and Karen, and her brother Trey, to carry this financial burden alone, so we are reaching out on their behalf, with all money collected going directly to support Claire’s treatment. If you are able to help, your donation of any amount would be most appreciated and forever remembered.We apologize if you are learning about Claire’s cancer via this page. Claire is known and loved by many and we were unable to reach out to everyone personally. It is understandable that you may have questions about Claire’s circumstances and what the future holds. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or if you just want to reach out to offer some love and support. We will do our best to respond. We know these are difficult days for all of us – financially, physically, and emotionally. It's always hard to ask for help, especially when so many of our friends and family members are in need right now, too. Thank you to all the people who have already been on this journey with us, and to those of you just learning about Claire’s cancer. Your support means more than we can express. Claire and Steve, are so appreciative of the outpouring of support and love they have received already, and look forward to sharing good news with you all!"
Medical,A.L.S. MIKE CUTTER,"Norfolk, VA",152520.0,150000.0,131,638,2.3K,"A.L.S. - Tough Motha Cutter Campaign Thank you so for taking the time to read this post as you may or may not personally know Mike Cutter, his wife Amy and their sons Stanton (15) and Archer (10). Mike is a much loved, lifelong resident of Norfolk, VA. He has been a close friend to many of you reading this and has been a dear friend to the many of us who have organized and disseminated this GoFundMe campaign. Five years ago, Mike was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Many of you are familiar with this horrible affliction, or even know another person who has ALS or has passed away from this disease - one that currently has no cure. ALS causes the death of the neurons that control voluntary muscle movement throughout the body. At some point, short of a miracle, it is fatal to all who contract it. (please go to https://www.als.org/understanding-als/what-is-als for more information). Our collective goal with this campaign is to keep Mike, Amy, Stanton & Archer (and their dog Ranger) in what has truly become their family home - for the long term.If you know Mike and his circumstances, then you have likely observed his life dramatically change in the last few years - particularly in the last 12 months. Mike has reached the point where many everyday functions are no longer possible - such things as eating, getting dressed, climbing the stairs, going to the bathroom, taking a shower, answering the phone, walking outside, and getting into the car. Thanks to his employer, Mike has been able to continue working remotely and should be able to do so for the immediate future. While other options were seriously contemplated, Mike and Amy have decided that it’s best for their family to remain in their home - and the time has come where they need help in turning their home into one that is suitable for someone with his limited mobility. It is the intention of this GoFundMe Campaign to raise at least $150,000 to make some of the necessary additions & renovations to the Cutter home in order to accommodate Mike's disabilities. This will include, but not limited to, modification to home entrances, renovation of a downstairs room into a master bedroom, the addition of a downstairs bathroom with disability fixtures, a motorized wheelchair, a motor vehicle with disability accommodation, and any other ADA modifications.  A born giver, Mike is very hesitant to ask for much in the way of help - so we are doing this for him and his family because we all love him! Please join us and donate financially to help the Cutters meet the challenges that lie ahead. If you are a contractor or business owner who wishes to donate materials, services or labor to the Campaign, please contact me, Archie Wright (757-374-3594) or Jeff Parker (757-478-9920). In Mike's WordsIn 2015, after months of testing on my right hand, I was shockingly diagnosed with ALS. For a while I lived without great complication due to the slow progression of my form of ALS; I have only in the last year or so felt its increasing debilitating effects. My arms are very weak - I’m no longer able to drive and I usually need help eating and getting dressed - and I am now having trouble with walking. I miss helping others, playing ball with my boys, and walking our dog.  Other than mental anguish I am in no physical pain (unless I fall and bust my head open or break a collar bone - yep that’s happened). I am confounded with my current position, more easily angered and often frustrated; but despite my physical and mental battle each and every day with this beast, I’m still in good spirits and try to laugh at myself while remaining positive, faithful and hopeful. I’m most proud of my family; my 24-year marriage to my wife Amy, and being blessed with our sons Stanton (2005) and Archer (2009). We very much appreciate your willingness to help make possible this transition in our lives and in our home.With much love, thanks and humility,MikePlease take the time to think and pray about this opportunity to offer financial support to this campaign - no matter the amount. We all thank you for doing what you can to help Mike, Amy, Stanton, and Archer.Thank you,The Organizers"

She suffered multiple fractures in her back and a completely severed spinal-cord. Over the coming months and years, Julia will have needs that will not be covered by insurance. We are here to support Julia in her long road to recovery and rehabilitation. Our first objective is to have her begin this rehabilitation in her hometown of Boston. This week she is being transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown, MA to begin this work. Many of you know Julia Carr Gangemi as your classmate, teammate, neighborhood tutor, or gymnastics coach. If not, you definitely know her as the star cheerleader being hoisted gracefully into the air at every Boston Latin football and Northeastern basketball game. Julia is the main attraction in every aspect of her life. Born and raised in the West Roxbury/Roslindale area, Julia is just shy of her 21st birthday. She is a BLS graduate, currently studying Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. She is a best friend and role model to her younger brother Sebastian, as well as a loving and devoted daughter to Beth (née Walsh) and John.Julia is in no way limited to the previous description.

Her inner spirit is evident and gives those around her the strength to meet each day's challenges. Julia’s determination is evident as she impresses the TICU staff with attempting all that is asked of her. And she has been able to laugh...even though it hurts. Julia, her friends, and family believe that she can regain enough mobility and learn the adaptive skills to live a full, productive, and meaningful life.Many people have reached out looking for ways to help and support the Gangemi family at this time. For those of you who wish to follow Julia’s journey and progress, we will be creating a Facebook page to keep you all updated.

Medical,Join Eric Sweet's Fight Against Melanoma,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",138391.0,125000.0,186,688,2K,"On Tuesday, May 5th, our dear and true friend, Eric Sweet, went to the emergency room suspecting he was suffering from COVID-19. What he would learn next turned the Sweet Family’s world completely upside down. Eric was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma, with tumors present in his brain, lungs, liver, and kidney. So far, he has endured two lifesaving surgeries to reduce the swelling caused by the aggressive tumors in his brain. He has begun radiation therapy to shrink the brain tumors and has also started immunotherapy, a new treatment for melanoma that will fight the cancer from the neck down. All of this has occurred in the space of just under three weeks, during an already incredibly difficult time for everyone. In addition to this devastating diagnosis, is the enormous expense that comes with an extended hospital stay, treatment, and surgeries.  The financial stress caused by Eric’s unforeseen medical emergency has been quite daunting for the entire family.  Adding to that uncertainty is a new job for Eric that does not provide medical leave, while Jodi’s industry is also facing unprecedented challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. With that in mind, our goal is to aim high and raise funds to lessen the great financial impact they are facing. This will allow every ounce of their thought and energy to go solely toward Eric’s treatment and battle with cancer. Originally from Logansport, Indiana, Eric met Jodi while attending the University of San Diego, where they were college sweethearts. Eric was the star quarterback and Jodi was the bubbly cheerleader on the sidelines! They married in 1988, and just celebrated 32 years of marriage in February. They have three beautiful, grown children — Kaelie, Logan, and Kyle. Both Logan & Kyle played college football, and, as a proud UCLA Bruin & WSU Coug dad, Eric never missed a game.   All three kids, who normally live in other cities, are currently home to support their father during his illness. Their presence at home during this time has been an enormous blessing and help to their parents.  Eric and Jodi are both very connected to, and proud of, the community in which they live and volunteer. Eric has coached countless kids through Pop Warner Titan and Mustang football, as well as RSM Little League baseball, even leading his 12u All Star team to the California State Championship! He has coached and volunteered at both St. Junipero Serra Catholic Grade School and Santa Margarita Catholic High School, simply because he loves being around and supporting local youth.  Jodi has been equally involved at both schools, and the hours that they have collectively donated so freely over the years are innumerable. The Sweet Family is extremely grateful for, and humbled by, the support of friendship, meals and fervent prayer they are already receiving from friends and family alike.  This includes the support of Jodi’s extended family from Mater Dei High School, Santa Margarita Catholic High School, the United Spirit Association, Varsity Spirit Corporation, and through many years of friendship, her fellow cheer judging friends from all around the country.   We do not want the Sweets to withstand this financial burden alone, so we are reaching out on their behalf, with all money collected going directly to support Eric’s battle and sustain the family during this difficult time.  If you are able to help, your donation of any amount would be most appreciated and forever remembered."

They were in the process of moving out of their house late Sunday night when  their neighbor fired rounds at members of the family. Makayla is currently in critical condition. She was holding her 1-year-old niece, Winter, when she was shot. She was found cradling Winter, who's life she saved. She was shot somewhere in the back of the head. During a CT Scan they found her skull had been fractured, and have removed a piece of her skull to allow room for it to swell. She is currently on a respirator, with a tube near her forehead to allow the blood to drain. It is unknown how long she will be in the hospital or if she will ever fully recover. The doctors predict she will have a long road to recovery. She will be in the hospital for at least 2-3 months with the piece of her skull removed, then even longer once it is put back in place, then she will need more care after that. It will be a long road to recovery. Please pray for her full recovery. Canisha is currently in stable condition. She was shot 3 times - once in her leg, left hip and once in her right ankle. Her hip and ankle were both shattered and broken. It's unknown how long she will be in the hospital and recovering. Canisha is a single mother to her one-year-old daughter, Winter, who is her entire world. Canisha will be out of work for an extended period of time.

The whole family showed symptoms, however, within a week only his oxygen levels dropped overnight and was rushed to the ER. His lungs had completely collapsed and the virus spread too quickly. He was immediately placed on and continues to be on a ventilator. Due to the rapid increase in COVID cases, he has not been able to receive the proper medication and continues to show little to no lung recovery. He is now facing other serious health conditions due to kidney failure, potential heart problems, fluctuating levels of blood pressure/sugar, etc. in addition to blood clots in his already damaged lungs. The doctors have speculated that he will continue to need critical care for the foreseeable future. 

He is a loving father and husband, hard worker, good friend to many, and firm believer in God. Even as he was leaving for the hospital, he kept a smile on his face and put all of his trust in the Lords plan for him. 

Due to this health emergency, both Daniel and Pauline have not been able to work for over 3 weeks and will continue to be unable to work. This situation continues to be trying on the family and the looming medical bills and mortgage payments have put undo stress on Pauline and his children.

We solemnly ask for your help and prayers, anything you are willing to give will be greatly appreciated by the whole family.

Medical,Pete Morkel - Wildlife Veterinarian - medical help,"Salinas, CA",125473.0,154000.0,210,717,3.5K,"Dr Pete Morkel: Wildlife veterinarian, explorer, adventurer, family man, horseman, keeper of Staffordshire bull terriers and a free spirit.Working as a conservation orientated wildlife veterinarian with a focus on wild and remote landscapes, and the wild animals that call these landscapes their home, can be really tough work.  Africa has an incredible diversity of ecosystems, landscapes, people, cultures, challenging governments and political spaces and is renowned for its outstanding biodiversity.  From steaming, hot tropical forests and swamps to deserts that stretch as far as the eye can see, to savanna woodlands and dense thickets, to mountains with snow-caps, rugged gorges and tumbling rivers, beautiful, untouched coastlines, with mangrove swamps and nesting turtles.  Forest and savanna elephant, giraffe, buffalo, lowland gorilla, black and white rhino, lion, leopard and the inimitable honey badger, and many, many more.Africa presents great challenges for anyone who wishes to get to know her well and this will often require a lifetime of endeavor.  But there is no doubt that a wildlife veterinarian with a continental African vision will face some of the toughest challenges.  Pete Morkel, African born in Zimbabwe on the 16th September 1960, is a man who has chosen to explore, discover and contribute to the African continent, plying his considerable skills as a wildlife veterinarian, an animal doctor who has experienced many things that others might only dream about. Challenges taken on with courage, focus and a desire to make a difference. An African adventurer, weathered and a survivor of these unrelenting and at times dangerous years (36), but as he enters the latter stages of his life, Pete faces his greatest challenge.In 2018, he was diagnosed with a metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, which had spread into the architecture of his prostate and some of his lower vertebra.  An aggressive, difficult to treat tumour located in a complex part of the body, he has been given a year to live. Radiation therapy, excruciatingly painful and debilitating has now been followed by chemotherapy, conventional and unlikely to impact on the prognosis. It is now May 2020 and as Pete and Estelle seek their privacy and peace on their remote Kambreem ranch, and Pete tries to build up his strength and weight, they are facing their greatest challenge together. Pete is not someone who gives up easily and through his medical knowledge was able to find out that his cancer had a very high tumour mutation of the bladder, but importantly there is positive PDL1 with a very high tumour mutation burden, which is in fact incredibly high with 56 mutations per mega-base.   His medical specialist suggested, as opposed to chemotherapy, that he should consider, if possible, immunotherapy.  The specific drug for Pete's situation is called Pembrolizumab, and will cost Pete and Estelle the equivalent of USD 7,083/treatment on a monthly basis.   The health insurance will cover a small percentage for a limited time. They need help!Before I discuss our decision to go for crowd funding, let me spend a little time talking about Pete and his life.  It would be impossible to cover such a rich and productive life so here are snippets of a life well lived. First and foremost, Pete is a family man with a wonderful wife, Estelle and 2 young adult children, Benoit and Cheri, who are also involved in the wildlife and conservation game .  They live on a remote ranch, Kambreek, in the southern reaches of Namibia alongside the Orange River.  This river forms the southern border of Namibia with South Africa. Kambreek is a rugged, waterless, boulder strewn and mountainous landscape and now, connected with the adjoining properties, it covers 52,000 ha.Pete is a graduate of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Onderstepoort, South Africa . His wildlife veterinary work has covered private practice, Government work in Namibia with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism and with the South African National Parks.  His career then expanded beyond the borders of South Africa to include work in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area with Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) followed by private wildlife work for organizations such as African Parks.  He has probably worked in more African countries then any veterinarian alive, with challenges ranging from black rhino reintroduction to Zakouma National Park (NP) in Chad, savanna elephant work in Garamba NP in the DRC and forest elephant work in Gabon.Pete is a world-renowned specialist with rhino, particularly with black rhino.  He and colleagues the first developed a de-horning technique for both black and white rhino in Namibia, during the early 1990s, as a risk reduction strategy to deter poachers.  His rhino work has become legendary.  Pete has continued to travel extensively over the last decade but with his recent diagnosis he has had to stop his fieldwork, passing it on to younger veterinarians.  He has taken a step back, re-engaged with his family and confronts his biggest challenge yet.  He and Estelle currently are ensconced on their remote ranch, they visit Windhoek on a monthly basis so he can receive his chemotherapy, but the nature of the cancer makes a cure difficult. Immunotherapy might be the only hope for a complete cure.  We are launching a platform to raise the funds to help Pete and Estelle and are calling on all their friends, colleagues and acquaintances from the four corners of this planet, to contribute to a crowd funding drive. Our target is USD 98,000!                                                                                                                                                                                                      Dr.  Michael D.

Medical,Help baby Zoe Fight Cancer,"Salt Lake City, UT",123238.0,200000.0,209,1.6K,5.1K,"On April 23rd 2020, our world was turned upside down. My sweet, loving 1-year-old niece, Zoe, was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. Zoe went from a happy, loving baby to one constantly in pain and crying. After endless doctor visits for over a month, we were given the news that would be any parent's worst nightmare. Not only is Zoe's case one-of-a-kind but it comes in the midst of a global pandemic, making it impossible for her Dad and family members to be present.Zoe's official diagnosis is Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) with a 9;22 translocation mutation presenting in blast crisis, meaning a large percentage of her cancerous blood cells are also growing as a second type of Leukemia, the much more aggressive Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). Besides the already very rare nature of pediatric cancer, CML is estimated to be 1-in-a-million of all pediatric leukemia cases that do happen, let alone the extremely unfortunate occurrence of Zoe’s cancer transforming into a second type. Simply put, successfully diagnosing and treating the probably unprecedented nature of Zoe’s cancer will be an especially complicated and uphill battle, even among childhood leukemia cases. On April 28th, Zoe started chemo to treat the blast crisis while the lab continues to conduct a more extensive genetic and molecular pathology and decide on the best treatment moving forward. After treatment, Zoe will need a bone marrow transplant in order to beat cancer. She is currently on the waiting list for a bone marrow transplant pending a successful first round of chemo.We are hopeful that with her team of doctors and love and support from those around her, our sweet Zoe can beat this and go on to live a happy, healthy life like any other child. Due to the current climate, we are asking for the support from our friends and community who wish to donate to help cover the surmounting medical expenses my sister and her husband will incur as they fight to help Zoe beat this. She is currently under the care of the Cancer, Blood and Transplant Team at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake.All contributions are greatly appreciated and will help to alleviate any financial burdens (medical expenses, travel, food) Kirsten & Theo incur during this devastating time.There is no donation too small. If you are unable to donate, please continue to share her story! Any unused contributions will be donated to assist others in battling leukemia.Thank you! Allison, Kirsten, Theo & Zoe"

The person who struck him was driving on the shoulder and hit him from behind. Stevie was airlifted to a hospital in Everett, Washington. Stevie suffered severe injuries, and is currently in critical care in the ICU. Stevie suffered a broken back, broken leg and brain damage. He had a compound fracture in his leg, and they have discovered bleeding on his brain, and contusions on his lungs.  He had a 6-hour surgery to stabilize and decompress his spine, but we still don’t know the long term effects of his injuries. During college and after graduating from Western Washington University (WWU) in 2019, Stevie has done a number of jobs helping and serving others. Stevie worked at a homeless shelter in Bellingham as a community liaison. After that he was a job coach for adults with disabilities, helping them to find and maintain work. This past year, Stevie completed a year-long campus ministry internship, where he mentored students from multiple backgrounds, engaged their spiritual questions, and introduced them to the love of his life: Jesus. Stevie was due to start his a job as a campus pastor this September, reaching students for Jesus at his alma mater, WWU, with Chi Alpha Campus Ministries. There are so many unknowns for Stevie’s future right now, and all of them come with significant expenses. Although Stevie has health insurance, we know that it will not cover all of his medical expenses and the cost of long-term rehabilitation and home care. Stevie's family also needs to remodel their home to make it wheelchair accessible for Stevie when he comes home from the hospital, as well as purchasing a wheelchair accessible van.  Would you consider donating to this fund so Stevie’s family doesn’t have to bear the brunt of the costs of the medical care and rehabilitation?  We are aiming to raise $200,000.If you are praying folks, please pray for a miracle.  We serve a God of power who loves to heal against the odds, so please pray for a full recovery for Stevie while you consider contributing to his family’s practical and financial needs. Thanks very much,The Cairns Family"

Also known as “Yaya” & the “BBQ man”.David McAtee was killed this morning in Louisville, Kentucky. He was a black restaurant owner in the community who was fatally shot by authorities around midnight on June 1st. As of 10:45 AM, his body was still lying in the streets. The National Guard had been deployed in Kentucky surrounding the protests, yet McAtee's death occurred at 26th and Broadway.... far far away from any of the protesting.  Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear had called on law enforcement to release the body cam footage of the shooting... but of course, their body cams were turned OFF. We should be absolutely horrified by this man's death and also by the fact that his body was left in the street for 12 hours after the shooting. There is no goal to reach and there is no dollar amount that will ever equal David's life, so this campaign will do everything in its power to secure as many relief funds as possible for the McAtee family. His mother also lost a daughter earlier this year.  As well as doing anything you can to donate to black-led organizations focused on ending police brutality, I urge you to give what you can to this cause. FAQ: Who are you? My name is Aida Osman. I'm a writer and community organizer. I have made direct contact with the McAtee family. Where is the money going? 100% of funds will be donated to the family to help funeral and memorial funds. As well as funding any legal action.

He treasured his time at Dalton and maintained his friendships until the end. After Dalton, he graduated from NYU,  appropriate, after all, as Sean always felt most at home walking the streets of NYC. Sean’s business career was varied, spanning art consulting, international trade financing, construction, and more.

He was lovingly devoted to his family, community and his church. He was so incredibly driven and encouraged everyone in his life to be the best that they can be. Saji loved his family and his late wife Julie Abraham dearly.Our beloved Julie Aunty was the perfect mother who portrayed hard work, joyfulness, dedication and most importantly unconditional love. Our family has gone through a lot of turmoil in the past 4 years with our Aunt, Julie, passing away from breast cancer 4 years ago and then our Uncle suddenly passing away a few days ago. The loss of both parents not only brings emotional pain, stress, and agony, it also brings financial burden, which they have now acquired as all 3 are currently still in school. We are here to support their family to get through these tough times. We hope you can help by providing financial support while they grieve their loss to help the family through these difficult times. We understand that everyone is going through their own difficulties with the current epidemic and are thankful for any support you may be able to provide including keeping this family in your constant prayers.

Memorial,Live Like Leo Memorial Foundation,"Moraga, CA",212688.0,300000.0,117,1.3K,4.5K,"On July 28th, our friend and his family suffered the most unimaginable tragedy in Lafayette, California.  As the result of a fatal bicycle accident, they had to say goodbye to their little light, Leo Cellura. He lived only 10 short years, but he was the best parts of all of us:  inclusive, selfless, and empathetic.

Leo was a champion of diversity—which came from his own diverse background and from having to reinvent himself as he grew up among multiple cultures and in multiple countries. Even at a young age, Leo was all about defusing tense situations with kindness and supporting people who need help. He lived his whole life this way and he touched so many people as a result.

Although the Celluras are only starting to adjust to their devastating loss, they also hope to honor Leo’s memory and inspire others to live as their sweet boy did. The Live Like Leo Memorial Foundation is founded on the very principles Leo embodied:  kindness, selflessness, and empathy. It will not reward young people based on their “accomplishments,” but will instead seek to build and support decent humans who care for others before themselves—and hopefully create whole communities of young people who live like Leo did.

Please join us in supporting their mission by donating to the Live Like Leo Foundation. All funds raised will be used only for the creation, funding, and support of this Foundation. 

Rest in Peace, Sweet Leo.

Memorial,Ben Kelly Memorial Fund,"Capitola, CA",153412.0,300000.0,198,1.4K,0,"On May 9th 2020, surfer Ben Kelly was fatally attacked by a shark while surfing in Santa Cruz County. This is a memorial fund set up by close friends of Ben Kelly. We want to support his wife Katie during this tragic time by covering all burial expenses and all of her living expenses for the foreseeable future. This is our tangible way of carrying on Ben's legacy of love and generosity. ------------ A Tribute--------------How do you distill the essence of a person’s life into a few sentences? Somehow tying words together in a way that simultaneously honors them, grieves their loss and also helps you cope with the shock and pain you feel knowing that they aren’t in this world anymore, feels impossible. But I have to try - I’m not sure of any other way to process this kind of freak, tragic accident. It feels like the ultimate form of betrayal to fall victim to the one thing a surfer recognizes and fears as a possibility. We sign the proverbial liability waiver every time we paddle out, but the thought of such a horrific event is dismissed as an extreme rarity. Those thoughts are quickly overshadowed by the joy and refreshment that comes from surfing and getting a good wave, and so we still choose to paddle out. Ironic that in all of this, the least I remember about him was how he surfed or even his style. Don’t get me wrong - he was a really good surfer. I can still picture his frothing face after getting a nugget. I highly doubt he’d care to be remembered for that though. The most memorable thing about Ben was his unashamed, unrelenting passion for his faith and his relationship with Jesus. I don’t say this to somehow selfishly reassure myself or others that he’s passed on to Heaven. I don’t have to wonder whether he knew Jesus, or whether his faith was secure. It was. Everybody knew it. He truly lived his faith out. In nearly every conversation I ever had with him, he tied God and the redeeming love of Jesus into it. He loved his wife unequivocally. He was stoked out of his mind whenever she’d surf and he was so proud of her. Adventure and travel was a huge part of their lives. They were dreamers, go-getters. Ben had an entrepreneurial spirit and drive that is so rare. He had such a special bond with her and it was evidenced by their sincerity and kindness to one another and their passion for serving others like Jesus. They were hospitable and fun, always down for a game night or a BBQ with anyone they knew. We're remembering: all those dawn patrols. Strike missions up and down the coast. Watching surf movies. Talking about shaping. Drinking cold IPAs and napping in the sun post-surf. His passion for a good board game. The way he talked so fast when he was stoked. How passionate he would get during a game of Spikeball. How he would read tax laws for fun. How much he loved talking about Jesus’ teachings and encouraged everyone to love Jesus more too. He was a good, godly, humble man who deserved many, many more laps around the sun and many more good waves. We all miss you, Ben."

A gifted guitarist and musician, he started playing guitar at the age of 12, and some of his greatest joys were playing for Harley and sharing his great love of music with her. He cultivated an extensive record collection which he was in the process of listening to alphabetically with Allie and Harley. Seppe was the Ficerai family cultural influencer, starting the annual tradition of listening to Girl Talk remixes while decorating the Christmas Tree and introducing his family to The OC, Quentin Terentino films, Led Zeppelin, Bon Iver and classic rock (influenced by his dad), Kurt Vonnegut and Michael Chabon novels, the latest edgy stand-up comedians, and so much more. Seppe had a spontaneous and adventurous spirit. He loved riding his Harley Davidson and recently completed a scenic bike trip from Austin, TX to Boulder, CO and Taos, NM to visit friends. Seppe also enjoyed skydiving and was instrumental in convincing his siblings to try the experience as well (and they are glad that they did). He spent time outdoors with his dog Topo, and enjoyed playing sports of all kinds, particularly his local soccer league with Allie. He was a lifelong Steelers fan, just like his dad, and was never shy about being the loudest in the crowd.Seppe took after his mom and enjoyed perfecting his cooking and barbecue skills, often  devoting hours, sometimes entire days, to preparing meals for the enjoyment of his family and friends. The whole Ficerai family spent Independence Day 2019 together in Austin, and Seppe stayed up all night to monitor his smoked brisket, foregoing sleep and shower to ensure that the family shared an unforgettable and delicious meal together. That was Seppe: incredibly generous, endlessly compassionate, and always willing to do whatever he could for others. During this particular visit, countless friends stopped by the house, and the Ficerai family watched as each and every visitor was greeted with open arms and a plate of food, in true Seppe fashion. He had inimitable charisma and an uncanny ability to make people laugh, especially with pranks, jokes and his memorable alter egos like The Raptor, Sabeachy, and an assortment of fake names he gave to his high school teachers. He was happy to be weird, often making requests of his mom like overalls for Christmas and affectionately referring to his loved ones by inexplicable pet names (such as “mollusk”). We will always remember Seppe’s humor and boisterous laugh. Seppe carried on this silly time with his daughter Harley, who inherited his zaniness, creativity and ability to bring joy to others. He loved Allie and Harley with all of his heart and was most proud to be a father. He often spoke of how lucky he was that Harley was the coolest kid, and he treasured being able to share his interests with her. He was so excited to welcome a second child with Allie, whom he lovingly described as an amazing mother, partner and support system for him, which was obvious to anyone who spent even a brief time together with them. Seppe took care of his family in every way: he was responsible, loyal and present, and he affectionately said he would do anything for “his girls.”Seppe’s compassion, life experiences and empathy led him to work in the recovery community. He cofounded Chuck and Joe’s Sober Living alongside his best friend Charlie Moffet to provide safe homes created for men in recovery, by men in recovery. He has also contributed to the recovery community through his work at Solstice Recovery Foundation, where he helped hundreds of other young men working on their recovery from drug addiction with his close friends Tara and Cole Shiflet. Seppe also inspired and partnered with his parents, Joe and Chico, in their “Six Steps to Sanity” ministry to help the families of children struggling with addiction, which will continue in his memory.Seppe knew how much his family and friends loved him and that we never stopped believing in him and in his recovery. He showed tremendous progress in and dedication to his sobriety since Allie and Harley came into his life nearly four years ago and until his sudden passing. We have boundless admiration for the way he fought this difficult battle. We are blessed to have had him in this world for 29 years, and take solace knowing that he struggles no more as we pray that he is now at peace in the loving embrace of God.We are grateful that Seppe was loved by so many who will continue to remember and cherish the time they shared with him. It will be through these stories and memories that Harley and his second child will grow up knowing the love, generosity, compassion and joyous spontaneity with which Seppe lived his life."

Many have paid the ultimate price, and with great heartache, I write the name of Muhamed ‘Hamo’ Music, who has passed on after a 6-week battle with COVID-19 on May 11th, 2020.Hamo was a father, a husband, a son, an uncle, and a great friend to an endless number of people, who like me, were lucky enough to be part of his life and him of ours. As much as my heart aches, Hamo is survived by his lovely wife Radija and three beautiful children - Belmin (13), Aida (12), and Armina (11). Hamo was an anchor of the family who looked after his wife and children endlessly and also took great care of his parents Abdulah and Saima.One of my dearest and best friends is Hamo’s brother, Aid Music. Aid and I have best friends for over 15 years now. Before I even met Hamo, I heard stories of Hamo from Aid. I heard stories of hard-work, of perseverance, of love, of care - I heard about a man who continuously put his family ahead of himself. Hamo, like many of us, is an immigrant from a war-torn Bosnia, who came here to give his entire family a better life. Hamo was a truck driver who worked endlessly to give his family a new start, a new outlook...to give them back what was taken from them.I will never forget the first time I met Hamo. Hamo was a towering figure and intimidating when he walks toward you. That intimidating figure deflates as soon as he greeted you with a firm handshake and as soon as he would start asking you how you were doing. He would want to know how your family was, and for us younger guys who were Aid’s friends - he always wanted to know when we would be getting married. His words were always genuine, sincere, and he always wanted the best for everyone and was genuinely thrilled when he saw others doing well.My dad always told me that the hardest thing to do in life for any parent is to have them bury their own child. This is what Hamo’s parents had to do. Hamo fought COVID-19 for weeks and did all he could with the support of doctors, nurses, and staff at the Swedish Covenant Hospital.At this time, Hamo’s wife, children, and the entire family need our unwavering love and support. Hamo is with us through his teaching, jokes, and love. Still, his love and presence can never be replaced - especially for his son Belmin and daughters Aida and Armina.We are raising money to help them today, tomorrow, and in the future. We raise money as a community, as friends, as family, and even as strangers to help a family when it is vulnerable the most. Hamo would have done it for us, and without hesitation, we are doing it for Hamo, Radija, Belmin, Aida, and Armina,On behalf of his wife, children, and the entire family, I wholeheartedly thank you for your generosity, care, and love."

He is doing well and in NICU for the foreseeable future. Sadly, we know this is a crisis in America that is not affected by education or income. According  to the CDC, Black women are three to four times more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than white women. Black women are more likely to experience preventable maternal death compared with white women. Tragically, this crisis has now affected those of us who loved Arika.Arika  was a dedicated public servant, who served honorably in the Obama Administration, both in the Office of First Lady Michelle Obama and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She then went on the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor, and at the time of her death, was serving at the American Hospital Association, communicating the critical needs of the nation's hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. She cared deeply about school nutrition and ensuring that every person has access to affordable healthcare. Arika was a 2008 graduate of Oxon Hill High School in Maryland and a 2012 graduate of Lee University in Tennessee. She was just 29 years old. Arika - or Sam, as her family calls her - was incredibly dear to all who loved her.  She was brilliant, beautiful, incredibly kind, funny, and was so excited about becoming a mother. She LOVED to travel. She had impeccable style. She adored her large family and all of her friends, and, of course, her native Tobago. With the blessing of her mother, this GoFundMe is set up to assist the family with all of the unexpected costs they will incur as they prepare to celebrate her life and carry her across seas to lay her to rest. Every dollar raised will go directly to Arika's mother and family.Thank you for your kindness and generosity, and please keep Arika, her son, her entire family and everyone who loved her lifted in your prayers."

She was as fierce as she was generous, and in her career as an educator, she fought passionately for her students. She enchanted people with her words, her extravagantly decorated acrylics, and her genuine, caring heart. On April 27, 2020, our dear sister and friend Rana  lost her battle to Covid 19. She was 30 years old.In her struggle to get treatment, Rana was dismissed by medical professionals at every turn. She was turned away twice at the hospital, and one EMT went as far as suggesting she was having a panic attack. Her pain and symptoms were not taken seriously until she was unable to breathe unassisted. She spent over 30 days on a ventilator, but by the time her symptoms improved, her body had simply endured too much.This is a story that is all too familiar for Black women. While Covid 19 ultimately took her life, institutional racism played a significant role in Rana´s death.Rana was a writer and a middle school teacher. She was a profound advocate for ending institutionalized racism and combating the disparities and inequalities faced by minorities and the LGBTQ+ community. More than anything else, she believed in the power of our youth, of the countless black and brown teenagers our society dismisses, demoralizes, and discards. She was a hardcore geek and an incredible storyteller, delighting her readers with vivid, earnest glimpses into her life and the neighborhood that raised her. At home, she delighted her family with her chef skills and her loud, joyful laugh.In addition to losing a loved one, Rana´s family is managing funeral expenses, medical bills and suddenly becoming a one income family. Your support will allow Rana´s family to manage these unexpected expenses in this time of stress and uncertainty.While I, Rana's friend, set up this campaign, it is was done at the family's request. All donations will go directly to  the beneficiary of this campaign, Rana's sister, Mia Mungin."

Memorial,"For MacLemore, with Love","Brooklyn, NY",102810.0,100000.0,203,905,2.6K,"On May, 6th  Lloyd Cornelius Porter gained his wings leaving his family, friends and the  Bedford-Stuyvesant community heart broken by his passing. He left behind his beloved wife and soulmate Hillary,  his daughter and angel MacLemore, and the countless lives he touched.  In Lloyd's honor and memory we are starting a scholarship fund to support MacLemore's education and future. We are sad but Lloyd's was a life lived with love and generosity that is deserving of celebration. Lloyd and Hillary owned Bread-Stuy, a little cafe that became the town hall of our community. In this shop,  love was poured into each cup served, smiles given with each pastry, hugs, laughs, jokes and fellowship lived every corner of the shop spilling onto the sidewalks. It was on those sidewalks that we ate, drank, danced and celebrated life and community daily.  That shop and the book store right next door breathed life into our section of Bed-Stuy - which the New York Times referred to as Sesame Street. As a friend said, Lloyd was our very own Mr. Hooper with a ready smile and common sense words of wisdom every day, even on the worst day.  That little shop and the Porters gave birth to careers, relationships and yes, babies. In 2008, more than 13 babies were born and Bread Stuy was the thing each and every parent had in common. We often joked it was the coffee. Lloyd, Hillary and MacLemore were set to move to California next month. They were kissing their beloved Brooklyn goodbye and returning to the place where Lloyd and Hillary began their story.  Yes, May 6th feels dark but the Porters painted rainbows over our Bed-Stuy skies, and around the world with each person they touched... and for this reason we will return his love and treasure his memory by supporting his family. This is for MacLemore, with love."
Memorial,In Honor Of Manuel Ellis,"Seattle, WA",102763.0,350000.0,180,2.3K,4.7K,"Manuel was a young father who loved his son and daughter and a talented musician at his church.  We are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many Black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories. His father died from stomach cancer when he was 2 months old, and a difficult childhood led to struggles with addiction and mental health needs, undiagnosed for many years. He was musically talented; he could play anything on piano, keyboard and drums simply by listening. He loved being a father to his 18 month old daughter and 11 year old son, and was very involved in helping his sister raise her children.At the time of his death he was continuing to grow in the fullness of his potential. No matter where he went he had his bible in his hand, a testament to his new found faith that he used to bring his family closer together through the church. He raised his daughter and his nieces and nephews with the understanding that because they were Black their conduct must reflect the understanding that being killed by police was a very real possibility for them and would always be justified by the broader society.Still, we never thought we would see him dead at the hands of the police. We  are heartbroken and angry that his life was taken by unaccountable officers of the state. We call on our community to pressure the police department and the mayor to release the identities of the officers who killed Manuel, their disciplinary records, complaint history to the public and all autopsy records and information gathered on Manuel to his family. We also call on our community to prevent all media and government prosecution of Manuel in the public sphere.We thank you all for hearing us. Please join us in fundraising for our legal fees and other needs as we navigate this difficult time. While we are in immense pain we rest our hope in the community of committed freedom fighters that we are now joining."

Emergency,Rebuild Chabad at UD,"Newark, DE",547055.0,1000000.0,91,9.4K,37.4K,"On Tuesday, close to midnight, a fire was started at the University of Delaware Chabad. The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. This was not an accident. This was arson.This is bigger than just one house. This is about students losing their Jewish home away from home.The UD Chabad Student Board set up this page to start raising money, initiating the love, support and rebuilding even before the Chabad Directors fully processed the loss and figured out the next step forward.This student-led initiative ultimately turned into our official campaign for rebuilding.We, all of us, Rabbi Avremel, Shulie, the Student Board and the Jewish community at UD, feel your embrace and support from around the world. We are so grateful to you and your gift that will rebuild at UD.Thanks to your love, and with the encouragement of our colleagues, layleaders, students and alumni, we are increasing this campaign to $1,000,000 to completely cover the FIRST PHASE of this new home for our students.We can’t replace what was. Someone maliciously burned down this sacred space, “the little blue house,” that grew so many magnificent memories for hundreds of students over the last 20+ years!The little blue house means so much to the students who found inspiration, community, connection, and even love there. Yes, many marriages started out by meeting each other at the little blue house.It wasn’t fancy, it was well worn, lived in, and much loved. It was theirs, and the students thronged there every Friday night. And now, the little blue house is in ashes. The objects and walls that could tell so many tales about Jewish connection and community are no more. Someone destroyed more than the little blue house. They destroyed the walls that held 20+ years of memories, life, and laughter.The little blue house is gone. As we mourn the memories, we must rebuild to create new ones. Like the fabled phoenix, We must rise up from the ashes, stronger, younger, and bigger to live again.For over 20 years, one hundred students would cram in the little blue house. Together we can give them a place to host double that size. Double the memories, double the space, double the laughter.This is what happens when the entire community comes together with a powerful surge of love, support, and togetherness.In the shadow of the fire, and amongst the ashes, a light of unity will shine brighter and much longer than the fire of destruction.Let’s Help Chabad UD Rise Up!-------We wanted to preserve the original plea from this student-led initiative. Here it is below --On Tuesday, August 25, 2020, at around 11 pm a fire was started with intention, at the University of Delaware Chabad. The fire was set at the back of the house, but the damages spread throughout the entire property. Although they tried to salvage what survived, there is not much left. In its entirety, the fire took about three hours to extinguish and while initial estimates put the damages at $75,000 further inspection gave an estimate of $150,00 - $200,000 in damages. No one was present in the home when the fire occurred. Chabad at UD is a home away from home for many Jewish students at the University of Delaware. Each week they open their doors, for Shabbat dinners and other programs such as holidays, celebrations, and learning opportunities. All of this wouldn't be possible without Rabbi Avremel and Shulie Vogel. Their constant generosity keeps students coming back each week. Rabbi, Shulie, and their three children have created a family at UD and have devoted their lives to bettering the Jewish community on campus.This campaign is being run by the students of Chabad, it is the least we can do to kickstart the larger campaign that will be rolled out shortly. Please consider donating whatever you can to help contribute to fixing the damages caused by the fire. All funds will be given to the Vogel Family to rebuild The Chabad House. The little blue house, which we students called home, will be missed, but it is time to give back and rebuild what we have lost.From all of us - Grace Hollander, Haley Levine, Jessica Ehrlich, Sarah Chalmin, Nikki Matza, Louie Gelb, Alex Beigelman, and alumnae Gabby Taubenfeld, and Ariana Marks -  we thank you for your donations to a cause so close to our hearts!"

A devastating wildfire surrounded the couple's home in the early hours of the morning, and despite the heroic efforts of Chris and Angie, Angie's mother, Peggy, and the couple's 13-year-old son, Wyatt, were killed by the fire. At first, Wyatt was missing and there was hope, but 2 days later he was found in the driver's seat of the family's car with his grandmother Peggy, his dog in his lap and had not survived the Santiam fire. Angie is in critical condition in the burn unit.What we know happened...there were high winds and the power went out and Chris had left to get a generator. Angie awoke to flames surrounding their home. Grandmother Peggy had broken her leg a week earlier and was awaiting surgery. Angie had loaded her mother in the car and by the time she got Wyatt and the animals, the car was surrounded by flames. Knowing it was life and death and there was no way to drive the car out, Angie told her 13 year old son Wyatt and his dog Duke to run. Angie stayed as long as possible to try to get her mother out of the car. but was not successful. She had no choice but to leave her mother, hoping Wyatt would be 10 minutes ahead of her. It was pitch black outside except for flames and smoke and their driveway was very long as was the road back to the main highway.  However, Wyatt did not keep going toward safety, and instead went back to the car and tried to drive his grandmother out of the flames. The road was so hot, it burnt the tires up. He was a heroic boy, trying against all odds to save his grandmother.  All this happened while his father Chris was desperately trying to get back to his family. Blockades had been set up and in desperation he ran the blockades. He found a woman on the road, wearing what looked like a bikini, feet burnt to the bone, unrecognizable.

Chris put this woman he did not recognize in the car and said he was sorry but he had to keep going to save his son and wife. Her mouth was black and was not able to speak, but finally whispered ""I am your wife."" After desperate searching, the car was found 2 days later with Wyatt in the driver's seat with his dog in his lap and his grandmother in the car. Angie survived the fire but suffered full-body burns and is currently in critical condition at the burn center in Portland. Her road to recovery will be a long one and will be further complicated by the devastating loss of her mother and child. The couple's home and possessions are gone. The medical costs from Angie's physical injuries will be enormous, plus the funeral expenses for Peggy and Wyatt. Chris and Angie's life will never be the same. While no amount of money can bring back Peggy and Wyatt, our family would be incredibly grateful for any help you can provide. This fund will help Chris and Angie deal with the extreme financial devastation this event has caused. Read more details about the tragic family loss from the devastating Oregon fires in this Statesman Journal story. What happened as told by Capi Lynn of the Statesman Journal Peggy was a devoted grandmother who always had a smile on her face and always had kind words to give.

Emergency,Sparks Family of 8 Fatal Car Accident,"El Cajon, CA",247825.0,250000.0,132,2.4K,52.2K,"SPARKS FAMILY FUND - SAN DIEGO, CAOn the morning of July 12th Brad and Crystal Sparks, along with their six children and their yet unborn child, were traveling home to San Diego from San Antonio, Texas. The family, including Cameryn, 13, Bailey, 12, Landon, 10, Sadie, 7, Jackson 5, and Wilson, 3 had just spent two wonderful weeks visiting close friends in Texas.   As they drove down the pitch-dark highway in the middle of what seemed to be nowhere, a tragedy occurred, and they lost control of their vehicle. The Suburban veered from the road and rolled multiple times in a horrific accident that landed it upside down in an area that passing cars could not see them.  The Suburban had been almost entirely crushed, leaving both Brad and Crystal, who is 7 months pregnant, and the family suspended.  Unable to move, Brad was able to use voice command to access his Apple Watch to call 911 for help.  Some of the children were able to release themselves from their seat belts and crawl out and made their way to the side of the road, hoping to find help.  But the parents, Brad and Crystal were unable to remove themselves for over an hour.Help came but, not soon enough for everyone. Even with the help of two Life Flight helicopters and six ambulances, two of Brad and Crystal’s children could not be saved. The couple’s beautiful daughter Bailey, age 12, and their sweet son Landon, age 10, both suffered fatal injuries and are now with the Lord.  Crystal was Life-flighted from the scene taken to the hospital. It took the Jaws of Life to remove Brad from the vehicle and he and the four children were rushed to two different hospitals.The family sustained a seemingly endless number of critical injuries. Brad was left with a fractured face and a broken knee. Cameryn suffered a broken clavicle and severe cuts all over her body. Crystal has suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and a shattered foot in addition to extreme wounds on her body.  It is a miracle that six of the eight family members were able to walk away from this horrific accident. They are now beginning the slow process of recovery. Nonetheless, the excruciating physical pain and the unbearable, overwhelming grief is more than just about anyone could bare. Despite this, the family stands firm in their faith and trusts that their God will be glorified. The couple’s unborn child appears to be healthy and is maintaining a strong heartbeat. The family looks forward to welcoming the baby in October.This is a loving San Diego family that is incredibly involved in their church, putting God first before all else in their lives. Crystal is a devoted mother who home schools all their children.   Brad is a hard worker and a dedicated employee for Symons Fire Protection in the San Diego suburb of Poway.We ask for your prayers and assistance in supporting this young and precious Godly family as they attempt to physically and emotionally recover from this unimaginable tragedy.This GoFundMe Campaign will help the Sparks with the impossible financial fallout of this fatal car accident.

His amazing, loving and kind momma, Wendy Ludwick, just lost her husband to cancer a few months ago.  She is now raising her two children alone, on a school teacher’s salary.  Y’all, she is the kindest and best of us.  Definitely one of our better angels and Gavin did NOT deserve this.  I know the world is haywire right now.  I know the future is uncertain.  But this is where we need to shine and lift up those of us in need.  All the money raised here will go to Gavin’s medical care, therapy, and anything the family needs to care for him, and themselves, as they focus on his healing and rehabilitation. The perpetrator has been arrested.  Thankfully, the attack was caught on a neighbor’s security camera.  However, little Gavin is fighting for his life now and his future is unknown.  He was intubated and some of his very fractured skull removed to allow his brain to swell without further injury.  I am asking, as a mother and human, that you give anything.  One, two, five dollars.  Any little bit is appreciated to help this family face what we know is going to be a long, hard, expensive road ahead.  If you are unable to donate, please consider sharing this post. We are all praying for Gavin to pull through and your prayers are much appreciated, also.  Please.  We’d all hope others would do the same for us if we were in this situation.  I will update as more info comes in on the investigation.  I am grateful for whatever you can give."

Emergency,Todd Wahl Memorial Fund,"Sandy, UT",190002.0,200000.0,45,1.7K,7.5K,"On Friday, October 9th, while doing the thing he is passionate about, riding his bike, Todd was in a tragic accident. Thankfully, he wasn't hit by a vehicle and a passerby saw the accident and was able to call for help. Todd was life-flighted from Park City to the University of Utah where they spent the next 24 hours discovering his injuries. He has broken ribs on both sides, a broken neck, a broken sternum, and most devastating, his back is broken at T7 (below his diaphragm). Consequently, Todd is now a paraplegic. They still haven't been able to assess the damage to his pelvis or knees. As you can imagine, the family is absolutely devastated, afraid, and overwhelmed. This news comes just weeks after finding out they are expecting their 2nd baby, due in May 2021.  Anyone who knows Todd knows he is the funniest, easy-going, honest guy who prides himself on providing and caring for his wife, Jessica, and 3-year-old son Nolan. They have the sweetest love with no lack of healthy banter. They are some of the hardest working people you will ever meet. Jessica is a health care worker for a local children's hospital and Todd a Project Manager for a construction company. He works a very physically demanding job, he loves to build things, is an avid cyclist, and loves doing anything outdoors. This year has been a long one. They purchased a home almost a year ago that needed a complete renovation. Todd worked a full-time job during the day and went to the new house after he got off work and worked late into the night and every weekend getting it liveable for his family, doing most of the work himself. During this time he saw his family very little. They were able to move into their home in June, but they still have several things that were left unfinished. If you know this family, you must also know that they are both fighters. Jess and Todd are both in long-term recovery, and both have more than 10 years sober. Jess is terrified about what their future holds, but she is holding it together for her family. Todd is currently in the surgical ICU with no clear idea of when he will be able to start rehabilitation. At this point, he has had two surgeries and will likely need more. He does have use of his arms, but the broken sternum is preventing him from bearing no more than 10 pounds. The University hospital is not in-network for their insurance and the hope is that once he is out of the ICU he can be moved to an in-network hospital to continue receiving care. The road to recovery is long and the financial strain is overwhelming. Everyone is asking what they can do to help, and right now, the most helpful thing would be for them to be able to focus on his rehabilitation, instead of how they are going to pay for it.  Jess is currently taking unpaid time off because her PTO must be saved to have time off when their baby is born. This money will go directly to the family for medical bills, rehab, and equipment for him as well as equipment to make their home wheelchair accessible, and any other related expenses. Todd's spirits range from joking with the nurses to being absolutely crushed that he may never mow the lawn with his little buddy again. Jess feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now and I am hoping, with the help of people who are as kind and generous as they are, we can help carry them through this. She never asks anyone for anything and reluctantly agreed to let me start this fund because she never wants to be a burden to anyone. I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to read this. If you can't donate, please share and say a prayer for their family. In an attempt to help alleviate the stress of keeping so many people updated, I will share updates directly from Jess to this page as often as they are available."

The Free Thinker Project is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization committed to bringing unheard truths to communities of people that have been misled by the Left and the mainstream media for decades. I am also a freshman at the University of Alabama and longtime conservative activist. As we approach the 2020 Presidential election in November, the Democratic party has made their position on law and order clear. They do not support it. As violent mobs burn our cities and destroy our businesses the left either sits back and watches or joins in themselves. This recent Anti-American outbreak from the Black Lives Matter organization and Antifa has left police departments across the country defunded and in ruins.  The institution of the police force is part of what allows this country to be great. These men and women risk their lives so we can sleep in peace at night, but how does the left repay them? By making it nearly impossible for officers to support their families. That is why The Free Thinker Project will be launching this “Refund the Police” fundraiser in support of our law enforcement. In the coming weeks, we will work to identify departments across the country most in need of our support. We will help the departments in whatever way is needed, and all proceeds from this fundraiser, apart from administrative costs, will go directly to the departments.  This year we are in a fight for our country, a fight for our lives.

— Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) August 17, 2020I'm Brian Haner. Just moved to Apache Junction AZ two weeks ago .  Adam Haner's is my little brother. He's living in Portland, I was right across the river from him in Vancouver WA before I moved. Hoping this money will help Adam get things together for his life after the attack he suffered. I know he will need repairs, or to replace the truck that was wrecked. He is going to need time to recover from his injuries as well. Plus replace things that where stolen from his pick-up that night, on Aug 16th. which happens to be my birthday. His girlfriend had some help getting his truck towed home while he slept tonight, Aug 17th. Maybe he will use some of this money to move out of Portland, or just use it to move up. I really don't care what he uses it for. He would give the shirt off his back to help any of the people around him, and he really didn't deserve what happened to him in Portland. I'll supply updates here as I can, and may update the 'story' on the GFM to better detail how this will all get handled. I really through this up in a hurry, because I was getting so many messages to start the GFM for him. After spending most of my day looking for information on what happened to him, and letting my mom and family know he was alive and home, I started replying to all the DM's and messages on social media, and started this GFM and replied to as many massages as I could. I currently have enough free time in Arizona to mostly keep up with something this demanding. So hopefully, I'll get to reply to all of you that have question, want proof it's really for Adam, and get you updates as there is information available. Huge Thank You to everyone showing him support. This is going to be an awakening experience for my brother in so many ways. He's always been cynical about the world at large, but has always been someone willing to step up and speak up to help someone being treated unfairly."

Chris was a loving a husband, a proud father, and a doting grandfather. He was also a talented veteran stuntman, a member of ISA, a Tae Kwon Do black belt, an exceptionally loyal friend for all those he met, and was hilariously funny. There was never a dull moment when Critter was in the room. He loved California, surfing, walking his dogs, riding his motorcycle, Kim’s cooking and their collection of lunch boxes. He was an incredibly rare person and the world went darker without him in it. He and his beautiful family have always been the kindest people, keeping their home open to all who wanted company or needed help.

Emergency,Travis' Journey Ahead,"Rockville Centre, NY",133872.0,125000.0,86,1.2K,651,"Our 29-year-old brother Travis has always been the life of the party-the wittiest and most sarcastic person in the room. He has a passion for friends, family and music, recently having started his own Record label, Modern Static Records. While participating in an annual charity event, on February 2, 2020, Travis suffered a severe spinal cord injury at the C5 and C7 levels, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. He underwent multiple emergency surgeries, before being classified as a quadriplegic.   As the Covid-19 Pandemic hit with full force, Travis was prematurely pushed out of his NYC rehabilitation center and as a result, he has not had the opportunity to gain proper physical rehabilitation nor counseling to deal with the emotional and mental impact of his paralysis. Since the onset of the pandemic, Travis has remained in his Long Beach, NY apartment, where he is cared for solely by his loving girlfriend, Ilana, and mother, Lynn. Travis will have many expenses going forward, including a handicap-accessible van to transport him to therapy/appointments, a motorized wheelchair, and an in-home aid. Some other expenses include physical and occupational therapy, doctor visits, medical supplies/equipment, home renovations and potential experimental therapies and treatments. Suffering a near-fatal and life changing accident in the midst of a pandemic has not managed to break Travis’ spirit. His adaptability, hopefulness and perseverance have inspired everyone who knows him. We would appreciate your help in making this journey just a little bit easier for Travis.All money raised will be going to the Travis Gentile Supplemental Needs Trust."

He went unconscious, has a deep wound on the back of his head, experienced immense bleeding. The paramedics arrived within 15 minutes and transported him to Danbury Hospital where they sedated and intubated him, and a neurosurgeon performed life saving surgery to help with the large amount of swelling that was/is occurring in his brain.His vital signs are stable, he is in the ICU, but he has a very severe brain injury.

While Project Walk is one of the best facilities in the country and is only about 30 miles from home, it does not accept insurance. Scott's journey will be long and challenging but with the strength of everyone behind him, we are very hopeful and optimistic about his recovery. Many of you have reached out throughout this most difficult time and asked how you can help.    It is with a humble heart that we are asking, on behalf of the Saums, for your support to help Scott  get back in action.   With the true cost of his injury as yet unknown, we do know that many accommodations need to be put into place.  Household modifications along with outpatient therapies will be costly, but invaluable and essential for his best possible recovery.  All monies donated will be put into a trust established specifically to cover out of pocket costs for Scott's recovery.We thank you for being part of #Strong4Scott during this most challenging and complicated time. Thank you all in advance.

Words cannot express our gratitude. Miracles have occurred in my dads situation and everything the doctors have been telling us from the beginning has been devastating but he has the strength of a Lion as most of you may know so he’s pushing! Unfortunately the road to recovery is very long and costly and he’s relying on all of us. 

Shlomi’s story:
On June 6th 2020 Shlomi had a hard time breathing and was admitted into the hospital with ARDS caused by COVID-19. He immediately was put on the ventilator and was put into an induced coma. Being in critical condition and given a 5% chance of surviving, he struggled with multiple infections, kidney failure, lung failure, blood clots, and many other obstructions. At the hardest point he was on 100% oxygen from the machines and that was almost not enough to keep him breathing. He pulled through and 2 months later woke up. He since then has been doing dialysis daily and oxygen reliance from machines has been decreasing slowly. He recently tested negative for Covid and is starting to rebuild his strength. His battle is far from over with multiple types of rehabilitation needed. Once off the ventilators (God willing sooner than later) he will need to be immediately moved from Kaiser to a rehab facility that does dialysis, physical therapy, and speech therapy in house. Unfortunately his health insurance doesn’t cover this type of facility and we are seeking out for your help. 

We are beyond blessed to say that he is now in recovery mode and has beaten the worst parts of this virus. These are the tough times we are reaching out for your help. His long journey is just now beginning.

Prayers come first and contributions second.We are going to need all the help we can get and greatly appreciate anything you can contribute. 

Again, thank you everyone for everything your blessings will help my dad recover. 


Thank you everyone for your blessings and donations today is Shlomi’s 96th day in the hospital ❤️❤️❤️ 9/11/2020"

Last night during the Lake Street riots following the murder of George Floyd, his business was vandalized, and three large store windows were shattered and his store was looted. This isn’t the first time that Jose’s business has been broken into, his store was robbed and looted just a few weeks ago while shut down due to COVID-19. See news story below:News Story Also, last year in June, Jose hired someone to install a new exhaust hood in his restaurant location, but the man who was to install it, disappeared.

Emergency,Help the Chongs: Englewood Store Looted and Burned,"Chicago, IL",104480.0,500000.0,176,1.1K,3K,"We are reaching out to family and friends to share our parents’ story.On May 29th, after months of being shut down due to COVID-19, Englewood Beauty Supply was getting ready to finally reopen and serve its community in the South Side of Chicago. Our father had spent hours with his employees preparing the store in order to ensure the safety of his employees and customers, and despite his own health issues which put him at high risk, he decided that it was important to open up his store to support not only his livelihood but his employees’ livelihoods as well. On May 30th, all of that effort, and the efforts of a lifetime were destroyed by looting, while our dad helplessly watched for hours from the security footage on his phone. Our father opened his small business in Chicago’s South Side 30 years ago after immigrating from Korea to America with absolutely nothing. Englewood Beauty Supply was more than a business, and over the decades it became a fixture in the neighborhood, with relationships built with community members. Our father had worked tirelessly and relentlessly without taking days off, working almost 365 days of the year so that he could support our family without complaint and serve as the best example to his children of positivity and the value of hard work. This is not the first setback that our parents have faced. In 2007, when our home was destroyed by lightning, the store was a source of hope, a way to rebuild, and start again. Our father’s same positivity, strength, and heart that he put into his store helped us rebuild our home over the years.  It breaks our hearts to see how defeated they are this time, and we would like to give them hope as they rebuild again. The world is hurting and we understand that this was a result of the hurt and the need for change.  We empathize with the outrage that has come from the lack of change and unjust treatment of the black community, and we stand by our community and those who are suffering. We also know that our parents are hurting, and it will be a long road of recovery and healing. Unlike large businesses, our small business insurance does not cover the entire cost of damages and stolen goods. We are humbly asking for support in rebuilding our parents’ business and thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

We are at a loss of words and unsure how to move forward. We are asking for support during this time as the costs for repair are unimaginable and devastating.

He received a phone call from the Sutton volunteer fire department around 7AM saying that all of his harvest equipment was on fire. This included a combine and corn head, a tractor, and two semis.  What makes this so unusual is the early morning timing and the fact that all of his equipment was parked away from each other.  Our family wants to take care of the resources we have been blessed with.  We want to finish harvesting our remaining acres and fulfill our grain contracts.  We want to provide for our families.  And most of all, we want to continue farming another four generations.I am setting up a fund  to cover the insurance deductible, the rental of equipment to finish the 1,000 remaining acres (approx. $30k just for the combine & head), and any expenses not covered by insurance.  Thank you in advance for your generous out pouring of love and donations.  The family is moved by the encouragement they have received on Facebook, from phone calls, text messages, and personal visits.                                                                        Sister of a Nebraska farmer"

Emergency,Marcy Maloy Recovery Fund,"San Francisco, CA",108510.0,125000.0,65,291,476,"On Tuesday, September 1st, only a month after her COVID compliant Zoom Wedding, Marcy was taking a walk in Golden Gate Park.  She lost her balance and had a terrible fall from a cement wall and severely damaged her spinal cord. She was immediately rushed to Trauma Center at SF General Hospital and had surgery within 24 hours. She impacted her C4-C7 vertebra, causing partial paralysis in her extremities. Marcy has limited mobility in her shoulders, arms, and left leg, and these areas continue to show very modest improvement. At present, she can not move her fingers. The weeks and months ahead will be instrumental in her recovery. Given the nature of her injury, Marcy will then require extensive physical therapy for at least the next year. On September 12th, Marcy was moved to the premier rehabilitation facility in the Bay area, the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.  Our family was elated that she was accepted at this facility because it is “out of network” from her current medical provider.Ron, her partner of 12 years, is determined to provide the best medical support for Marcy but now finds the prospective cost to be daunting. Over the next 6 months we will need the following:1.    In-Home Stairlift ($20,000)2.    Handicapped-Accessible Van ($35,000).3.    Electric Wheelchair ($3,000)4.    At Home Physical Therapy and Nursing Care ($125,000).No one could have predicted these events. Prior to the accident, both Ron and Marcy’s income had been reduced significantly because of COVID which makes the need to raise funds even more acute.Marcy has an indomitable spirit; some would say a je ne sais quoi.  She is incredibly kind-hearted and thrives with adversity. So many of you have already reached out to help and we sincerely hope you can aid in her recovery by contributing.All funds will go directly to Marcy’s medical costs and continued recovery. Many Thanks From Marcy's Family, Alexandra, Hannah, Ron, and Madeline"

Obituary
Michael David Dessino, 29, of Bloomsburg and formerly of Middlesex, New Jersey, wrestled his last match on June 1, 2020, after a horrific car accident. He was born on September 19, 1990 in Plainfield, New Jersey, to Michael and Denise (Goniea) Dessino of Middlesex, New Jersey. He married Katrina (Conrad) Dessino on August 30, 2019 and they were expecting their first child, Dominic, in September. 

Mike was a 2009 graduate from Middlesex High School, where he was a standout wrestler. He was a region 3 champion, three-time district champion, three-time state qualifier and two-time state place winner, placing 8th as a sophomore and 4th as a senior. Mike finished his high school career with a record of 145-22 with 98 victories by fall. He would later be inducted into the Blue Jay Hall of Fame in 2015. 
Following high school, Mike attended Bloomsburg University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and a minor in criminal justice in 2014. He wrestled for the Huskies from 2009-14, where he posted a 105-43 career record and ranks second in program history for career pins with 45. He was a three-time NCAA Division I national qualifier, three-time PSAC champion, and won the 2011 EWL title at 174 pounds. Mike’s 105 victories are 15th on the school's all-time list, while his three PSAC championships made him one of only ten grapplers in the program's history. Following his collegiate career, Mike served as a volunteer assistant coach for two seasons for the Huskies and had a brief run as a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. He went 4-0 as an amateur, picking up three of his wins over a six-month span in 2015 and his last victory in September of 2017; three of his wins came by submission. 

Mike was a corrections officer at The United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, and could be caught playing video games daily, eating gummy worms, or wrestling his fur baby, Jaxon. He loved playing paintball with friends, listening to podcasts, hiking, and going to the gun range. Mike was very computer savvy, building his own computer, and enjoyed cooking, especially making his grandma’s homemade pasta sauce. He was known for his love of Batman, Jeep Wranglers, the New York Giants, the New Jersey Devils, fishing and crabbing. Mike had a heart of gold and was described by everyone as loving, caring, loyal, patient, and humble, with an infectious smile that could light up any room. 

Along with his wife and parents, he is survived by two sisters, Brittany and Giovanna Dessino, nieces Lacey Dessino and Isabella Santos, maternal grandmother Ellen Goniea, in-law’s David and Marisa Conrad, grandparent in-laws Philip and Barbara Miccio, brother-in-law Brandon Conrad, and sister-in-law Cheyenne Conrad. Mike is also survived by many loving aunts, uncles, cousins and friends. Mike was preceded in death by his paternal grandparents Stephen and Beatrice Dessino, maternal grandfather David Goniea, grandparent in-laws Lucien and Janet Conrad, and his golden retriever, Sawyer.

Mike’s life was a blessing to all who knew him, and he will be greatly missed by his wife, family, friends and the entire wrestling community.

Holden is the most loving and caring person on Earth. Holden is a 2019 Graduate from Kaplan High school. He is a student at LSUE, where he was majoring in education. Holden is an optimistic and strong young man. Holden is a proud member and advocate of the LGBTQ community. Holden loves competing in speech competitions and expressing who he is! Unfortunately, Holden fell victim to what the family believes is a hate crime on June 20th, 2020, at around 11 pm. Holden was lured to the residence of another young man. This young man proceeded to physically torture and harm Holden for several hours until authorities arrived on the scene. The culprit physically hurt Holden in unspeakable ways. Holden has severe lacerations to both wrists, stab wounds, and lacerations to his neck and was found unconscious. He will need intense physical therapy, emotional therapy, many prayers, and love. Any donations towards Holden’s recovery would be much appreciated; he has a long road of healing ahead of him. No donation is too small, and if you are not financially able to donate, prayers are equally as appreciated. God was with Holden, and we know that God will continue to be with Holden through his recovery.

Everything my parents, Caryn Fried, 72 and Wayne Reynolds, 81 have worked so hard to build over the past 40 years has been reduced to ash and rubble. If there has ever been a time for funding and support from the wider community, this is it.For us, this loss is monumental.  Aside from all the things we personally cherish, we lost my parent’s life’s work, as well as both arms of our family business.  We are so grateful to discover, that a few of my mother’s sculptures have survived that were outside of the structures. This is a huge comfort to us.  All of our pottery and paintings, ceramics equipment, and our beloved Christmas tree farm are gone, meaning my parents have now lost all sources of income for the foreseeable future. 

With a devastation of this magnitude, the best insurance we could acquire does not come close to covering this loss.  We want to plant seeds - both literally and figuratively- to grow our business again. It is mindblowing to understand what goes into a physical business. It would take 7-10 years before a new grove of trees could mature for harvest.  The inventory of pottery in our gallery took years for my parents to create.  We need to safely clear the property of the remains of our 5,000 burnt trees, our studios, destroyed equipment, pottery and building rubble, and our home. We estimate needing upwards of $100,000 beyond our insurance coverage to begin to do this work and start the process of rebuilding our lives. Our Phase 1 GoFundMe goal, while we continue to assess damages and wait for more information from our insurance company is $150,000.  If 1,000 people could donate $150 we could do it, or 2,000 people donating $75.  If you are unable to donate, you could also help by sharing our link in an email to your network or reposting on social media. I would like to share some of my parent’s history.  Their life is their craft, and their rural countryside destination, a natural sanctuary for many.  My parents got their start living in an Oakland warehouse, selling their pottery on the streets of San Francisco. In the 1970’s they mastered their craft under Marguerite Wildenhein at Pond Farm Pottery among the Armstrong Redwoods. Since, they have made Sonoma County their home.  In 1987 Caryn & Wayne purchased their property along Highway 12, on the outskirts of Santa Rosa, and this is where I grew up.  Over the years, my parents created a unique destination where they have shared their artwork and taught the craft of making pottery. The purchase of the property brought with it a Christmas tree farm.  With the support of master arborist Gary Muerle, we cultivated the forest adding 10 varieties of trees from redwoods, to cedars, firs, and pines.  We utilized sustainable practices to allow our trees to regenerate and regrow.  Our pottery and “choose-and-cut” tree farm has hosted families for multiple generations.  Sharing the holiday with us has been a Sonoma County tradition. We are profoundly grateful for all the years of patronage from our students and clients these past four decades.  As a family, we have truly lived our dream and just can’t believe it’s over. The future is now quite uncertain for us. But we’re not giving up on Santa Rosa, we’re not giving up on Sonoma County, and it is simply impossible to give up on art. Thank you for your continued support in the days ahead. Thank you to the many, many people who have reached out offering us support, love and encouragement; we need our community now more than ever. We offer our deep gratitude in advance for the generosity of friends, family and strangers in our time of need as we begin our journey of rebuilding and healing our land and our family. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ANY AND ALL CONTRIBUTIONS.Thank You,Caryn, Wayne & Maya"

I am a wife and proud mother of a beautiful 2-year-old boy, Dean, and we live in New Milford, a small town in northern New Jersey. I was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer.  I need your help with medical expenses and family support in the fight for my life.On July 13th of this year, my entire world was turned upside down.  I was rushed to the ER with severe pain in my abdomen and the doctors discovered a large mass on my ovary. This set off a whirlwind of tests to understand the root cause of my illness. Days after my 35th birthday, and less than 2 years after having Dean, I was diagnosed with colon cancer.  The doctors initially thought it was ovarian cancer. They said they had to remove my ovary and I was rushed in for emergency surgery. I was horrified because my husband and I had just started trying for our second child.  The doctors gave us hope by explaining that I could become pregnant with one ovary, but our hearts were heavy. As it turned out, this was far from the worst of our problems. Days later, I received a diagnosis that will forever shake me to my core. I have Stage 4 colon cancer. It has spread to my lungs, liver and remaining ovary. As a statistic, I am grim.I was paralyzed from shock after hearing this news, in a constant state of tears. I thought about my baby, who needs his mother. I thought about all of the milestones I have witnessed in his short life, and the many more which lie ahead. I thought about our delightful, ordinary days.  Seeing his eyes light up at cars and trucks.  His hugs. Dean’s life without me is not a thought that my husband or I can swallow. Two months into chemotherapy treatments, I am in capable hands and grateful for my doctors. But I am quite ill from the treatments, and we have quickly learned that our insurance will not cover some of the most critical aspects of my longer-term care, including many alternative and integrative therapies and experimental trials.  I am a young mother, and a short life span of suboptimal quality simply will not do. My husband is becoming an expert in my care, and I recently became a vegan under the direction a nutritionist who challenges traditional approaches to cancer and food.  I also continue to be an active mom to Dean, who is blissfully unaware. He celebrated his 2nd birthday this month amid the great excitement of his new toys and trucks. In the coming months, I need to travel nationwide to get treatment from doctors who don’t accept my insurance and receive medicine that is not covered either. I will undoubtedly need primary care from my husband, who will have to take time off without pay. The financial costs we face are staggering, but we are strong and determined.  We will not give up without a fight that will make our son proud. We are telling you our story because we need your help. If you can make a financial donation to help us, we will forever be grateful. Our son will grow up knowing the goodness in others, who gave his mother a chance to continue fighting to be here for him. If you cannot donate, please share our story, or share stories with us about people who challenge traditional boundaries in the fight against cancer. Every little bit helps.Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this."

He spent every day of his 40 years on this earth giving to those around him. Caring for strangers, quietly serving.  Giving the shirt off his back and the Jordans off his feet.  You likely heard his moving message to #savethekids and #savetheparents, encouraging us to put our phones down and go live a beautiful life. He shared this message 500 times a year all over the country.On October 20, 2020 he suddenly passed away surrounded by his family. We are shattered, and he leaves behind his beautiful wife Elizabeth, their four amazing kids: Avery, Quincey, Lola and Myles (and their dogs Tuque and Winston Bishop, too). They were his world and he was theirs. The hole he left in our family will never be filled, and we know he touched hundreds of thousands of you, too. Collin had big dreams for this world, and his family, and we have been inundated with love and support, wondering what can be done to help. We've created this fundraiser to help ensure that his family can continue living a beautiful life. That although he might not be here to take them fishing, or to the beach, or sing them songs to help them fall asleep at night, we will be the hands to lift them up. We know we and his community will give back, since he gave us all so much. Collin encouraged Liz to go back to school to get her Master's, and without a life insurance policy and their champion Collin, they are facing a lot of unknowns. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, for any contributions. We ask for privacy for the family in this trying time.If you'd prefer to Venmo you can send directly to his wife @Elizabeth-Kartchner. Cards and condolences can be sent to PO Box 921 Pleasant Grove, UT 84062A celebration of his life is TBA.Email michelle at [email redacted] for questions/inquiries."

Animals,Save Anthony,"San Diego, CA",40755.0,50000.0,63,484,933,"Anthony Sinsay and his family have had a tragic series of events and are in need of help. Anthony and his wife are both chefs who met in the culinary world. Anthony has worked as the executive chef for many restaurants along the Pacific Coast, sharing his Filipino culture with the community. He is known for his strong advocacy for sustainable eating and supporting local farmers and businesses, as well as his appearances on shows such as Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. His wife, unfortunately, developed debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome and had to leave the culinary industry. She is currently going back to school to transition to a new field, and the family is getting by on a single income. However, in November of 2019, Anthony was diagnosed with late-stage cancer and had to immediately begin intense chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Disability pay and rising medical bills put a severe burden on them, but they were able to persevere with help from close friends and family members. Their world was upended again this summer when Anthony was let go as an executive chef because of the economic strain COVID-19 has placed on restaurants. Anthony and his family are now left without employer-provided medical insurance and seemingly insurmountable medical bills, even with family members giving what they can financially.Any amount is greatly appreciated and will go towards paying for Anthony’s life-saving treatment and providing for their family. This fundraiser is being hosted by Anthony’s brother-in-law in San Diego, CA at their request, as they have plenty else they are dealing with at the moment."

Protester bails were exorbitant due to deliberate actions by the District Attorney that were designed to punish us simply for exercising our First Amendment rights—some bails even reached $750,000. The district attorney continuously extended the bail by 44 cents after posting bail causing the bail to be rejected resulting in keeping protesters locked away for an extra 4-10hours. They were denied adequate medical care, adequate food, and water the entire process. Protesters were not mirandized, were unlawfully searched, and consistently antagonized by police officers and correctional officers. Not only were protesters beaten and dehumanized by police officers, their belongings were stripped from them to not be returned including: phones, watches, precious jewelry, wallets, backpacks, and cameras. Protesters were originally told they could collect their things after being released, and received property releases only for the  district attorney to void them the very next morning stating the items were needed as evidence. As we demand the end of policing, we must have each others backs as a community. This purpose of this fundraiser is to help alleviate the financial impact caused by the cruel callous institution many of us are protesting against, as well as a source of aid to comrades who are low income, homeless, or without employment. Any donation is beyond greatly appreciated and we thank you greatly."

Even in the best of times it can be difficult to survive as a small business and we now face an uncertain future. Even once we reopen, it will likely be under greatly restricted conditions limiting our business activities.  As you may be aware, The Stonewall Inn is the first national gay historic landmark and the birthplace of the modern day LGBTQ rights movement.  We celebrate and pay homage to those individuals who first stood up for gay rights and sparked the Stonewall Riots. Those brave souls who first stood up for their rights and the rights of others, triggered a global movement that continues to be celebrated world-wide via gay pride celebrations and parades.We resurrected the Stonewall Inn once after it had been shuttered- and we stand ready to do it again- with your help. We worked diligently to resurrect it as a safe space for the community and  to keep the Stonewall Inn at the epicenter of the fight for the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It has been a community tavern, but also a vehicle to continue the fight that started there in 1969. Stonewall is the place the community gathers for celebrations, comes to grieve in times of tragedy, and rally to continue the fight for full global equality.Today, we are asking you to help Save Stonewall!  The Stonewall Inn faces an uncertain future and we are in need of community support. The road to recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic will be long and we need to continue to safeguard this vital piece of living history for the LGBTQ community and the global human rights movement and we now must ask for your help to save one of the LGBTQ+ communities most iconic institutions and to keep that history alive.

Business,Please Help Hicklebee's Stay Alive,"San Jose, CA",243346.0,300000.0,182,2.3K,15.4K,"Hicklebee's: Where Books Come AliveIn 1979 four mom-friends seeking to find a balance between work and family rented a small space on the west side of Lincoln Avenue, filled it with children’s books and called it Hicklebee’s. The name, they said, described the final metamorphic stage of a bookworm. In its early years, the store established itself as a neighborhood living room of sorts. Readers, non-readers, paying customers or passersby, Hicklebee’s welcomed all.Eventually, two partners would leave, another would join in, and for the last 30 years, we would remain: a sister team who set out to make the name Hicklebee’s synonymous with quality, community and a commitment to literacy for all.Over 41 years Hicklebee’s has continued to operate through recessions, the Loma Prieta earthquake, the advent of Big Box stores and the aggressive business practices of a certain online retailer (ahem). Still, we persisted.       In March when schools closed and non-essential businesses were shuttered, we made the case that books are essential and partnered with the Santa Clara County Office of Education to create the Keep Kids Reading Book Drive- a campaign to put books into the hands of students during the Covid-19 crisis. To date, the program has delivered bags of books to nearly 400 families in need. Which brings us to this campaign.Hicklebee's has stayed open in a limited capacity during this pandemic, and while we have been working hard taking orders, shipping books and offering curbside delivery, the loss of foot traffic, community events and school business has been financially devastating. The money raised from this campaign will cover those losses as well as operating costs, including payroll, through August. It will also give us time to prepare for the return of school, for our doors to open, and to welcome our community back home.We believe that Hicklebee’s is as essential to its community as the gift of reading it offers you.We are grateful to our community and look forward to recommending your favorite books for years to come. Be well, and stay safe.Monica Holmes and Valerie LewisA few highlights from our history in Willow Glen and in the bookselling community over the past 41+ years:   - As new members of the Willow Glen Merchants Association, we joined the movement to plant trees along Lincoln  Avenue, laying the groundwork for a revitalized Willow Glen and planting the seeds- literally- for the thriving Avenue that exists there today.    - We were key organizers of the first Willow Glen farmers market.    - We have hosted major public events throughout the years, that feature local and international authors and dignitaries for our entire community.        - Hicklebee’s has worked with publishers, authors and national media to encourage literacy as well as diversity in children’s books.    - We have appeared on television, radio, in periodicals and published books to promote literacy.   - Hicklebee’s has received coveted local and national awards including The Small   Business of the Year Award 2009 presented by Senator Joseph Simitian and The Pannell Award from the Women’s National Book Association in 2019 and 2004. The Pannell jury wrote:   “The winner in the Children’s Specialty Bookstore category, Hicklebee’s Bookstore in San Jose, Calif., is celebrating its 40th anniversary this month.

The queer community of Harlem inspired me to create a safe heaven for everyone in the world, but especially for the LGBTQ community of HarlemMy intention was to provide employment, training, and potential small business ownership skills to the LGBTQ black/latino young adults of Harlem.  Alibi Lounge, in association with Strive International, created a program sponsored by the City of New York offering hospitality career training as a commitment to this goal. This ensured employment to those who achieved their training successfully. We have not gone without our own trials and tribulations.

But when conditions are harsh and life is tenuous, it takes a team sworn to reciprocity to keep life going forward.”As Bruce Springsteen says in Johnny 99: “Now judge I got debts no honest man could pay”.We hope to be able to pay our debts, and to keep providing great books and great conversations to our communities for many years to come.  We cherish, and desperately need, your support at this time.Thanks for all of your support these many years.  May there be many more!With Gratitude & Respect,Alison Reid and John EvansDIESEL, A Bookstore"

Ottobar began in a small location on Davis St in downtown Baltimore and has grown into the arts and music powerhouse venue known not just to our small gritty East Coast town, but the world. It’s as much a rock club as it is a museum for stickers and flyers from bands that have graced its stage over the many years. For those not in Baltimore, the Ottobar has been a cultural incubator for not just music, but performances of all varieties- It has been a nexus for so many of the creative folx that help to make Baltimore the wonderfully odd and fantastic city that it is. Some may remember, just last summer Tecla purchased the Ottobar in hopes of continuing the legacy of awesomeness that the venue provided to the community over the years. Her vision was to try and preserve Ottobar as it had been while forging ahead with new ideas and plans. Little did we know just what was in store for the music industry as a whole….There are so many venues that are having the same difficulties, and with no foreseeable help on the horizon the outlook is not great for any venue.You may consider donating to this campaign so that we can help her sustain Ottobar, until it is safe to experience live music again- no one wants to lose this cultural icon! Ottobar is an integral part of Baltimore's cultural fabric. The venue is under very real threat- the Covid-19 crisis has the club limping along at approximately 5% of normal. There hasn’t been any sign of it changing any time soon. Ottobar is a place that its community has depended on for many years to provide a vital space for the arts. It has presented THOUSANDS of concerts, poetry readings, book releases, film screenings, flea markets, art opening, spelling bees, and pet weddings to name only a few. The venue has also hosted MANY fundraisers, for social justice organizations, reproductive rights charities, environmental organizations, education in health initiatives and more. Alternative voices, minorities, women, LGBTQ+, everyone is included at Ottobar. We’re hoping this GoFundMe campaign will carry the venues' operations through this worst of times. Funds will be used for employee payroll, rents, basic operations, and supplies needed to protect all staff and guests to ensure their safety. We are deeply grateful to our loyal fans and customers and appreciate both the love and the financial support you have sent our way. Ottobar is and always was, a venue for people to gather and enjoy each other’s company, great drinks and interesting things to see and hear- Baltimore can’t afford to see places like this disappear!"
Business,40 Acres And A Mule Project,"La Crosse, WI",133390.0,250000.0,171,1.6K,4.4K,"The 40 Acres & a Mule Project came into existence when my endeavors and information sharing began to generate interest in the form of monetary support from others, both online and within my local community.  As one of the very few Black restaurant owners in the Coulee Regional area in Wisconsin, I focus my food and efforts on community revitalization through storytelling and civic projects. I have decided to set up a GoFundMe campaign for the 40 Acres & a Mule Project in order to collect money to buy agricultural land. This land purchased will be at least 40 acres and Black owned.  The proceeds of this campaign will:·       purchase of land to guarantee farm to table resources for the food industry; ·       serve to provide an outlet for Black foodways; and, ·       establish a safe haven to secure the legacy of Black foodways.   Historical context The term “40 acres and a mule” was derived from Union General William T. Sherman’s Special Field Order No 15 , issued on Jan. 16, 1865. The reparations movement, which continues to the current day, cites “40 acres and a mule” as the U.S. government's promise to make restitution to African Americans for enslavement. The significance of this promise to Black people was to present a conduit not only to be free, but also to own land and be integrated as a part of the fabric of the United States to achieve a more equal footing.  Freedom, land ownership, and the means to prosper were seen as a significant pathway to empowerment by enabling African Americans to be a part of the economy, create businesses, and community.  Why now?During these troubled times, there is an immediate need to protect and ground ourselves in land that we can call our own. There exists a need to create a legacy for our future generations.  The creation and sustainment of a legacy is one of the most important opportunities I see in the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"".  It is a great chance to be able to control our narrative and provide educational opportunities to understand our story in food and farming techniques within the hospitality and food industry. My vision is to have a sanctuary to hold the history, food, and stories of Black culture in food and farming.   This land will be used to teach other how to farm, archive Black food ways and the importance of Black farms.  The 40 acres of land will tell the story of how Blacks grew food through our ancestral ways into today. Where will the campaign proceeds go?Any contributions made to the ""40 Acres & a Mule Project"" beyond the needed funds to purchase the land, taxes, and tools for the farm will be made available to Black organizations that concentrate on preserving Black foodways and support Black farmers in purchasing their own land, buy the land they lease, and/or provide assistance to Black farmers for their mortgage payments.Follow my Instagram  dedicated to this project"
Business,Save Ken Sanders Rare Books!,"Salt Lake City, UT",127723.0,250000.0,124,2.3K,6.5K,"Save Ken Sanders Rare Books!Welcome to the GoFundMe site in support of Ken Sanders Rare Books. This counter culture institution opened its doors in Salt Lake City 24 years ago. Beginning with no money, few books, and a teenaged daughter, KSRB has grown into an overflowing powerhouse of an antiquarian bookstore known throughout the Intermountain West, and the world. It’s as much a book shop as it is a museum. It’s a place where Ken’s generosity allows the muse to dwell. For those not in Utah, many of you may have seen Ken Sanders on television from his fourteen years as a rare books and manuscripts appraiser on the popular PBS show, Antiques Roadshow. Ken’s bookshop is an integral part of the very fabric of Utah’s culture. His store is under very real threats, most immediately with the loss of sales due to the Covid-19 crisis that has the store running at approximately 50% of normal sales. We know we are not alone in this, but the pandemic shows no sign of going away any time soon. Please do help by donating to this fundraising campaign, we can’t afford to lose this cultural icon! KSRB is a place that its community has depended on for many years to provide vital resources by way of literature, poetry, music, art, specializing in Utah, Mormon, Native American, and Western history. It carries new, used, and rare books, paper ephemera, photographs, maps, rock and roll posters, letterhead broadsides, t-shirts, and things you never dreamed existed. The store champions natural history and environment, climate change, social justice, sustainability, radical politics, to name a few subjects near and dear to our hearts. Alternative voices, minorities, women, LGBTQ+, everyone is included. In addition to curating collections, appraising books and manuscripts, Ken has contributed to the book publishing world through Dream Garden Press, founded in 1980, to publish regional poets and authors. The store has hosted thousands of events that include concerts by musicians, poetry readings, book release celebrations, and film showings. To name only a few: Edward Abbey, Charles Bowden, Terry Tempest Williams, Wendell Berry, Tom Russell, Rosalie Sorrells, Utah Phillips, and Alex Caldiero’s dazzling performances of Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. Ken specializes in oral story telling, occasional writing, and has been featured in dozens of films and documentaries on notable subjects such as Edward Abbey, Tim DeChristopher, Everett Ruess, Ken Sleight, and Earth First! We’re hoping this GoFundMe campaign will carry the store operations through this worst of times. Funds will be used for employee payroll, employee health insurance, rents, basic store operations, and supplies needed to reduce the risks of Covid-19 to ensure the welfare of the staff and customers. We are deeply grateful to our loyal fans and customers and appreciate both the love and the financial support you have sent our way.  We encourage you to visit the store’s website to learn more about the store’s inventory and activities.Rare Books Need Rare Humans!There are a few reasons why you might contribute to help save Ken Sanders Rare Books which has become endangered due to the Covid-19 epidemic. You might contribute because you know or have met Ken Sanders personally. Maybe you know him as the gentle soul he is - whose dedication to books, art, nature, history and boundless curiosity have proven a priceless, positive contribution to the business of book selling and also to the world.You might contribute because you have a connection to Utah, Salt Lake City, the West and you appreciate the fact that Ken Sanders Rare Books is a portal unlike many other that still exist. Maybe you understand these bookstores and the people that run them are being pulverized between technology and Covid-19 and that being able to spend an afternoon physically rambling through musty stacks is an experience that needs to be preserved.Maybe you’ve seen Ken on Antiques Roadshow and get a kick out the fact that he could expound with deep understanding exactly why and how the 1930 Rockwell Kent illustrated edition of Moby Dick can possibly be worth so much money.Or maybe you’re just a reader and book lover and want to kick in.In any of these cases your contribution will be appreciated and put to good work. Thanks for being a part of saving Ken Sanders Rare Books!  WRITTEN TESTIMONIALS….In a forest, under the ground, there are networks of fungus fibers that connect the roots of trees together, allowing the trees to share information and resources. They're called mycorrhizal networks and they help keep the whole forest healthy. Ken Sanders Rare Books is like one of these underground networks. You walk into his store and you feel connected to healthy forest. Ken is the gnome who guards it. The Amazon Corporation is named after a forest but it has no underground, no roots or fungus. It’s more like a virus that kills trees. If Ken’s store closes, the forest dies. Simple as that, and tragic as the loss of a species. So I will work to help the store stay open. Scott Carrier, Journalist__________________________________________________________________________________________I think of Ken Sanders, as do most who know him, as worthy ofState Treasure status standing as he does at Utah cultural crossroadswhere desert rats, intellectuals, misfits, artists, writers, book worms,poets, philosophers come to weave tales with Ken and discover a newauthor, or a new trail of thinking. The bookshop is where we take visitors when we hope to answer the question:""Why Utah?"" posed by relatives and meaningful friends. They don't knowthat in our minds Ken is a sort of right of passage. If they gasp in wonder atKSRB-- they understand Why-- if they don't -- they never will. I have been a bookstore nut from the time I found Watkins, Foylesin London - Thorpes in Guildford and Hay on Wye in the 60s.They in their turn defined their time and place and reflected the British character for generations. The British bookstore, however, is genteel.  A thing of winter, tea and muffins,wooly scarves, cats and damp tweed.  KSRB is more sand in your hiking boots, thirst, chapstick, rocks in your pockets and brain sort of experience.   For years now I have been ranting on about the misguided plan for developmenton the site of our Utah Treasure. I can only hope that one outcome of this dreadful pandemic and inevitable Depression is that developers will not have their way with the land where Ken's Bookshop stands. It is our best mental watering hole.  Jann Haworth, Artist__________________________________________________________________________________________I can easier imagine a cordiality truce between Mormon crickets and seagulls than a closing of Ken Sanders Rare Books.  Name one other place in Salt Lake City where you can go for a thoroughly invigorating browsing and at the same time get a better half hour gym workout than Ken’s Place, and simultaneously—even though it may be unearned—be greeted and treated as an old friend.  KSRB is a SLC institution with an earned reputation for both inventory and eccentricity and our world would be diminished should this bookstore disappear.That said, as we all know, times are genuinely tough and Ken is having an even harder time than usual holding Yeats’ archetypal center together.  Now it’s time for us to render service and help an old and dear friend out.  I’m going to do my part and make a painful sacrifice: give up a minimum of three days’ worth of Happy Hour in his honor.  I cannot imagine a Utah world worth living in without Ken’s hanging in and being there as a visible icon; can you?David Lee, Apprentice World Class Piddler and Scribbler__________________________________________________________________________________________ I can’t recall the first time I met Ken Sanders, book dealer, river runner, cultural icon. But I remember all the moments since.I remember when he commissioned a family river trip with Moki Mak through Desolation Canyon, with fellow bookman Ken Lopez and his family, writer Scott Carrier and two of his young children, and invited me and the Peacocks: Doug, Laurel and Colin. It was my first big river, and 20 years later still ranks as one of my favorite trips.In the early 2000s, he hosted me for a reading at his store when I published my first book, Libby, Montana: Asbestos and the Deadly Silence of an American Corporation, about the death and destruction that the WR Grace Corporation wrought upon a small, working class town in rural Montana. I was a unknown Montana journalist., He had no reason to expect a profit from that event, but knew it was a story that needed to be told.A few years later, Doug needed back surgery and had no one in Salt Lake to take care of him. Ken took him to and from the airport and the hospital, made sure he had a place to recover and fed him all the while. Then, in 2010, Doug’s cousin Marc Beaudin and I had this half-baked plan to open a used bookstore in Livingston, Montana. Ken graciously, generously answered our questions from Day 1, and saw us through those first rocky years, providing references for scholarships, guiding us through our first book fairs, and ultimately sponsoring our application to the Antiquarian Bookstore Association of America. There is no better ambassador in America for the next generation of rare book dealers.Ken Sanders is simply irreplaceable.Andrea Peacock, Author, Activist, Bookseller__________________________________________________________________________________________ Few bookstores still exist that satisfy the craving for the smell of old paper, places where you can nose through stacks and magically, the book you need appears, even if it’s not the one you came in for. References and histories, rare books on order, entrance busy with every manner of human from the drunk to the erudite, and sometimes drunkenly erudite. If your city is fortunate enough to have one of these, I’d do everything I could to keep it.The community of Ken Sanders Rare Books extends past this city to all of the West, part of my life in my little dot of Colorado, and part of so many more authors’ lives, an avenue for counterculture and wilderness. Stories have poured through here to packed houses, every aisle and seat filled, a microphone up front, a reader, a singer on guitar, or sometimes only a handful in the audience, each rapt, so glad they came. Run by Ken Sanders himself, bearded guffawing laureate of literature from the Rockies to the sea, this shop is a cultural necessity. Historians may talk someday of how western society was nudged along by this man, by the tales he promoted and the eclectic range of books he brought to us. Keep this place alive. Don't give it new digs or put its name up in lights. Keep it as is. The next generation will need it even more.Craig Childs, Performance Author__________________________________________________________________________________________The pulse tells you a lot about the health of a body. A bookstore is the pulse of a city. KSRB has been telling us a lot about the health of local culture. At this time, the health of the city is not good. This is reflected in the health of our bookstores, and especially KSRB. For the past 24 years (a family-owned shop since 1997), KSRB has held its own. Now it needs a helping hand.This is not just a “book store” I’m talking about; not merely a venue for books. There are stores with books in them, and there are “book stores” (stores that sell books, as some stores sell shoes, or fish, or groceries). Then again there is the real McCoy: BOOKSTORE (one word). Today, there are fewer and fewer “bookstores”, that is to say, not merely a venue that sells books, but a PLACE where books wait for readers, and create a backdrop for cultural exchanges that promote art, poetry, film, and literary events. Add to these, rare and the collectible objects and artifacts, and you have a BOOKSTORE: KEN SANDERS RARE BOOKS, the real McCoy.On a personal note: my life both as reader and writer, would be a lot poorer if I had never entered this place. The major interactions and contacts with my community of readers and fellow poets/writers/filmmakers/ has been fostered by the physics of this place. This “bookstore” and the soul of the place, Ken Sanders himself: flesh and voice and beard ever growing wild.Given all of the above, to say that I endorse KSRB and efforts to save it, is an understatement. Let my voice join the chorus: LONG LIVE KSRB and may we preserve the health of our Salt Lake City.Alex Caldiero,Senior Artist in Residence at UVU and ever, your friendly naybohood sonosopher___________________________________________________________________________________________ Exploring Ken’s book store is like going on a weird Safari in a library after an earthquake.  There are books piled high, books tumbling down, books that rattle your very foundation. It is exciting and dangerous and it is one of my favorite places in the whole damn universe.  The universe needs Ken’s book store to keep things in balance.  If the store goes the way of the wind it could mean the end of the world!  It is not just an institution, it is a vortex of madness, a depository of all the great ideas that have ever been and an incubator for the brilliance to come.  Hell, Ken even sells my movies!  Trent Harris, Filmmaker"
Business,Save The Bookstore,"Lenox, MA",122528.0,120000.0,107,1.1K,3.4K,"Hello Bookstore friends near and far,Wondering how things are going at The Bookstore during the pandemic?  They’re not going well, my friends. When I think of the many roads I took to become your bookseller here in Lenox, I cannot imagine who or what else I might have become. It’s always felt to me a perfect fit, and to judge from the loyalty you have shown through the years, you think so, too. With that in mind I am appealing today for your help.As busy as we are every day – and yes, we are thankful we’re busy - the fact is this: business is down, way down.  Sales each week are what they used to be each day.Our well-known slogan says that The Bookstore has been Serving the Community Since Last Tuesday, but as many of you know I’ve actually been here since April 1, 1976, sitting at that front desk, happy to provide you with all those things that make our bookstore The Bookstore: the book you may not have known but fell in love with; the glass of wine at Get Lit; the poetry reading or book signing event that reminds you of the large presence in your life that is this small shop on Housatonic Street.We belong to each other, you and I. If you live nearby we usually see you pretty regularly. If you’re a part-timer, or a summer renter, or a weekender or just an accidental visitor, chances are if you came through our door once, you’ve probably come back again and again. In the old days I might have sold books to your parents or grandparents.  Today I’m selling them, curbside, to you, to your children and grandchildren.  But if I want to continue, and if you want me to continue, I am going to need your help.  The challenge is real and it is immediate. Government PPP was eaten up, just as it was supposed to be, by payroll and utilities early in the game. Curbside revenue doesn’t begin to cover the day-to-day expenses like rent, payroll, utilities, insurance and all the other costs of doing business. Until we can safely open our doors again, and I just don’t know when that will be, I most humbly ask you to help me get through.  My aim, my pledge to you remains the same as it’s ever been -  to offer the best in the world of books.  But Covid-19 is more formidable than anything we’ve ever faced.We’ve posted on our website over a hundred photos of the books on tables and shelves and will continue to do so until it’s safe for you to come in and browse. Safe for you, safe for me.  I know you understand.My predecessor started The Bookstore on a small loan from a family friend. That was 54 years ago.  I took over ten years later, and with your help, your devotion, and your commitment, we have made The Bookstore into an institution worthy of its reputation.  It’s yours as much as it is mine.None of us would even want to imagine it no longer being here.Our goal is to raise $60,000.  That will wipe out the shortfall from this spring and summer, and allow us to continue “serving the community since last Tuesday”.I thank you, as they say, madly, truly, deeply, for your support and look forward to many more years as your bookseller here at The Bookstore in Lenox.  And don’t be shy about sharing this link; we can use all the help we can get.Thanks for reading. Be well. Be safeMatt Tannenbaumhttp://bookstoreinlenox.com/#smallbusinessrelief"

Like many businesses on June 1st during the Fordham riots, our stores were looted, emptied, vandalized, and destroyed. As immigrants that built our lives here, our livelihood was taken away in one night. We ask first that everyone please be safe for us and any and all donations will be used to rebuild our businesses, medical expenses, and pay back our customers whose items were stolen that night. We are navigating the world of police reports, a totalled car, an unclear insurance situation, and losing the vast majority of our inventory. We greatly appreciate the generosity. Our story from that night..We were stuck trying to securely close the store but looters came in hordes and forced open our store gate and flooded in. We tried to get out. We tried to keep important items safe. But they saw. As we tried to get into our car, they attacked us. They smashed our windows. They attacked with crowbars, pipes, and bricks. They pulled my mom from the car. As my boyfriend Chao held onto her, they broke her leg. My jewelry, shoes, and phone were torn from me as they pulled me out from the trunk of the car while Chao tried to hold me in. My dad tried to fight them off and when we were finally able to drive away, they followed us. They got into their cars and tried to ram us off the road. We sped towards the police barricade and as the police surrounded us the looters drove away.Black lives matter. Black communities matter. This movement matters. These protests matter. We need to bring justice to the lives lost and healing to the communities. The Fordham community needs healing now. Please support the families and businesses that have been affected. I thank everyone that has come to the aid of my family and the heroes that work at St. Barnabas Hospital and SeniorCare EMS.We appreciate all your thoughts and prayers and generosity.

Business,Keep JamKazam Alive & Improving,"Austin, TX",106745.0,100000.0,202,2.3K,2.8K,"Hello Everyone - A few years ago, three co-founders created JamKazam and set out on a journey to fundamentally alter what is possible in the world of music performance. Our vision was (and still is) to make it possible for musicians to play live in sync from different locations over the Internet - as if sitting in the same room. Along the way, we added things like the ability to play along with your favorite songs, live broadcast performances, teach/take music lessons, and more.We invested a good chunk of our own money into this vision, and on top of this worked full-time literally for years with no pay to get JamKazam off the ground. We also managed to raise a little bit of money from outside investors, but honestly not nearly enough to achieve our vision. There is so much more we could do to make this service easier to use, significantly reduce latency (lag) in sessions, deliver great new features, and provide better support for our users. Unfortunately, at this point we have all been forced to take regular full-time jobs to support ourselves and our families, and we are running low on funds just to continue to pay the cash expenses to keep JamKazam running - things like hosting fees, royalties, and all the usual things needed to operate a business like this.We recognize it's a bad time to ask for help, given that millions of people are hurting financially and emotionally right now, but we need assistance to keep JamKazam operational. And we need more help if we are going to do more than keep it alive - to drive it forward to better meet the needs of the worldwide community of musicians. As we consider our options, we are also taking into account that musicians need JamKazam more than ever, as none of us can meet up in the same place to play together. And this is likely to continue to be the case - at least in phases - for quite some time. We want to help, and this is how we can best do it.If you decide to contribute funds to support JamKazam’s mission, we will use these funds to improve the service. A short list of things we’d like to be able to do, depending on the level of support from this GoFundMe, include:Reduce Internet LatencyWe’ve had a solution on the drawing board for years now to reduce Internet latency between musicians significantly. We’ve conducted experiments that prove we can do this, and recently we’ve built the technology to do it. But we do not have the capital to deploy this technology. This is at or near the top of our list and is key to making JamKazam work better for more musicians and bands.Guarantee Session ConnectionsMany of you have noticed that sometimes other users are “grayed out” in your sessions, and audio won’t stream between musicians when this happens. This issue is caused by the networking approach we use, and this problem would be fixed by the same Internet latency reduction we described in the bullet above. We can make network connections work in 99%+ of sessions. Provide Better SupportRight now we cannot provide any support to our users. We simply do not have the time and are very overwhelmed by the surge in the use of the service. We’d like to have someone available to provide support, but we would need to be able to compensate someone for doing this. At the least, we’d like to produce more and better help documentation.Fix Bugs & Improve User InterfaceThe user interface on the JamKazam application was never great to begin with, and it has not aged well. The app would benefit from a UI refresh. The whole app would also benefit from a comprehensive testing process that identifies all the bugs that have cropped up over time, and a dedicated effort to fix these bugs to make the application more stable and reliable. Help Musicians to Generate IncomeAnother area where we can help is to improve JamKazam’s broadcast features to enable bands to generate income from performances, and to enable music teachers to generate income from higher quality lessons online.What Else?We have plenty of other ideas of great things we can do, and we will also most definitely continue to listen to all of you – our JamKazammers – to help guide our path forward. All of your feedback over the years has helped the JamKazam service to become what it is today.Thanks to everyone for taking the time to consider supporting this JamKazam GoFundMe. We believe in the power of music and its importance in people’s lives. We hope you'll join us in the work of helping musicians play together and share their art and performances with fans everywhere.Best Regards and Stay Safe,David, Peter, and Seth(the JamKazam co-founders)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------p.s. Here are some links to videos that show more of what JamKazam can do:Watch how 6 bands played together from different locations in Austin at our Virtual Jamfest launch See how far we have pushed the envelope with a band playing live from Chicago Austin Brooklyn and Atlanta Learn how you can play along with your favorite bands and songs  Consider teaching music lessons on JamKazam with far better audio quality and far lower latency than Zoom Live broadcast your performances on YouTube Facebook and Twitch for fun or use our integrated ticketing features to generate income We cannot produce the JamBlaster product due to a lack of capital but it is nifty"
Business,Keep Kitchen Arts & Letters Open,"New York, NY",105266.0,100000.0,70,1.2K,1.8K,"Keep Kitchen Arts & Letters OpenFor 37 years at Kitchen Arts & Letters, we’ve loved being a unique resource: a bookstore devoted to the world of food and drink:. We've been here for professional cooks, home cooks, food writers, and anyone else who wanted to be part of that community.(Above: a scene from our annual clean-out event, where we sell old and damaged books cheaply to good homes. 50% of the money raised that way in past years has gone to Edible Schoolyard NYC.)Now,  however, our survival is at risk, and we have to turn to you for help. Our usual sources of income—everyday customers, major food conferences, restaurant chefs—have all been dealt staggering blows. Without them, we’re not coming close to paying our bills.We want to keep Kitchen Arts & Letters open. We want to keep bringing you the important, groundbreaking, and unusual books from home and abroad, and the personal service that tells you we love what we do here.We have a vision for going forward that builds on all we’ve been to our community through the decades. We’ want to become even more useful to food and drink people by  making our website faster, easier to use, and a more complete reflection of our full inventory. We want expand our searches for books you won’t find elsewhere. And we will continue to tightly control our costs. But to be brutally honest, without outside support we’ll have to close our doors in the near future.A bookstore run for and by people who really care about food and drink booksWhen we opened in 1983, store founder Nach Waxman greeted many people who poked their heads in, among them a man who looked around and declared, “It’ll never last,” then wished Nach good luck and left.But the store became a destination spot. Nach remembers Julia Child walking in, kicking off her shoes, and sitting down on the floor to inspect the contents of the French section. We became the place where you can find not only classics like Julia’s books, but fascinating passion projects written by authors who self-published because they couldn’t interest a big publishing house. The place to find books imported from England, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Australia, Ecuador, and Argentina.Our basement—the marvelous treasure-trove basement, from which Nach extracts countless out-of-print volumes, some to consult, some for sale—became a legend.And every day that we’ve been open, we’ve been helping people find the right books for their needs. Not necessarily the most popular or famous books, but the ones that matched someone’s skills and ambitions.That’s what’s made these decades so satisfying. (Above: Visiting authors have included chefs like Massimo Bottura and Ferran Adrià)We’re at a crisis pointThe pandemic hit New York City hard. Many of our core customers have been devastated by restaurant closings. In-store traffic stopped for many months and has only weakly revived as people have, rightly, remained cautious.  We’ve kept hoping there will be some dramatic improvement in our fortunes. And now our lease has to be renewed. Nach and Matt agreed early on that the one thing we would not do is lay off our staff, two brilliantly talented and helpful part-timers who had already lost the incomes they made working in food service.But otherwise we’ve cut our costs as deeply as we can while retaining the character that has made us valuable. We can’t cut more without ceasing to be Kitchen Arts & Letters.(Above: We're proud to have hosted authors such as Stella Parks and Andrea Nguyen, who brought food!)Please help us stay aliveWe want to remain the place you find the books you were always looking for, the place that has the books you never dreamed existed. We want to delight you with books signed right here in the store by your favorite authors. We want to do for you exactly what a specialist bookstore is supposed to do: connect you to an amazing, ever-growing world of first-rate books.We want you to be able to walk in the door and be immediately distracted by an offbeat new publication. We want you to visit and overhear a pastry chef from Japan talking to a food writer from Pennsylvania. We want to help you find a recipe for the stew that grandpa learned to make growing up in Poland but never wrote down.And we want to continue to send you news of great books, new and old, that deserve attention because of the work of extraordinary authors.So we’re asking for whatever help you can give us to survive this crisis, endure in the idiosyncratic style that we’ve been known for, and evolve to be an even better resource for you. Financial support would be wonderful. So would be sharing the news of our campaign.And if we fail in this effort, please know that we’re profoundly grateful for the amazing world we’ve been part of for all these decades. Food really does bring out the best in people and we’ve been privileged to see it in our friends and customers.Nach WaxmanFounding PartnerMatt SartwellManaging Partner"

My ancestors live on through me.I am a farmer, food advocate, chef, writer and photographer. I have been working in agriculture for the last five years, studying organic and sustainable farming practice and documenting the lives of farmers through my writing and photography. In 2019, I visited over 30 farms in five western states, listening to the stories and highlighting the experiences of farmers. With Black farm ownership at only 2% in the United States and with threats to agricultural systems and widespread food insecurity, now is the time to set forth on a dream I have been cultivating for the last decade. I am currently searching for land to start my own farm while writing and researching the challenges facing new and aspiring farmers, especially Black farmers.I have always dreamed of working on my own land. As a Black, queer, woman land ownership has felt evasive for much of my life, not having the capital or the generational wealth to make this possible. I want to build a dream together, founded on regenerative, no till practices and paying homage to the traditional ecology knowledge of my ancestors, and the land’s original Indigenous caretakers. I am building seed fund to start a small scale farm, and I need your help. The seed money we raise will contribute to:- the down payment on a 3-10 acre property;- start up costs for farm equipment such as walk behind tractor, seeders, hand tools;- farm infrastructure such as irrigation, wash house and coolers.If possible, I would love to stay on the west coast where I have a large network of farm, restaurant and agricultural community.  We are meeting with brokers and exploring different avenues throughout California, Oregon and Washington. Where ever we build, we will be contributing in monthly land tax and forging partnerships with Indigenous community. 2020 is the year!Why now? In this time of horrific pain and reckoning over systemic racism in this country, it is crucial to not just support Black people in our deaths. You must also support Black joy, uplift Black liberation and invest in Black-led organizations and entrepreneurs.

We primarily serve refugees, immigrants, communities of color, youth and seniors. We provide mental health and wellness-based services such as cognitive behavioral therapy, family therapy, peer support groups, nutrition education programs, integrative health practice sessions and stretch therapy for seniors. Our staff are predominantly people of color; they consist of clinical social workers, licensed counselors, marriage and family therapists, and culturally-competent interpreters who reflect the diversity of the community of Minneapolis. The founder, Sulekha Ibrahim, is a public health nurse that has used her leadership role in developing culturally appropriate programs and strengthening initiatives for vulnerable and immigrant/refugee populations. Her vision is to expand the clinic to ensure that individuals from marginalized communities in South Minneapolis have access to resources, support, and opportunities to facilitate and improve their mental and physical well-being.On Friday May 28th, Healing Path Wellness Services was unfortunately vandalized and destroyed. The clinic suffered extensive fire and water damage. We are a Black-owned mental health clinic located in the heart of South Minneapolis providing culturally appropriate and accessible mental health and social services. Systemic racism, oppression and poverty affect our mental, emotional, physical and social wellbeing. We not only experienced this firsthand but witnessed its effects within our community. Our top priority is serving marginalized populations, our Minneapolis residents need our support! Our vision is to ensure the community has a safe space to be empowered and receive social services that increase their quality of life.In the wake of George Floyd's murder, our community has experienced devastating and traumatic events.

We need to remain open to continue to provide services for the diverse residents and youth in the twin cities. We stand firmly with our community to demand justice. Our community needs us! In addition to rebuilding the clinic, the funds will be used for the expansion of services. Twelve of our employees rely on our clinic for their livelihood, we are collectively grieving this loss and our hearts are heavy for our community members and clients.We are truly grateful for your support and generosity!

With full reopening still to come at a very limited capacity, we are asking for your support as we navigate this uncertain future and try to keep our doors open. Established in 1950, the Kettle of Fish has a literary history as being the local watering hole for Beat writers including Jack Kerouac, musicians including Bob Dylan, and eclectic Greenwich Village artists and bohemians. Originally opened on MacDougal Street, the Kettle moved twice and just celebrated its 70th birthday on June 8th, with 21 years in the heart of Greenwich Village at 59 Christopher Street. Kettle of Fish is also a globally known destination bar for visitors to watch Green Bay Packers football games, so much so that Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers paid an off-season visit in 2019, and previously other Packer greats such as Jerry Kramer, John Brockington, and Dave Robinson have stopped by for games, camaraderie, and meet-and-greets. With boisterous group singing, Usinger’s brats, and a group of passionate gameday regulars, it’s a unique experience.Whether you are looking for a place to grab a pint and read on an afternoon, meet up with friends for a few after a long week, or just Wisconsin sports fans watching the Badgers, Brewers, or Bucks (oh my!), all are welcome at the Kettle of Fish. The cultural significance of the Kettle of Fish in this historic district, and on this street in particular, exemplifies New York City’s dedication to diversity in all forms. With iconic Greenwich Village institutions in danger of disappearing due to this pandemic, we ask our fans, friends and community to help keep us here for years to come! Another way you can help is to spread the message! Please share this on social media using the hashtag #savethekettle."

Shortly after, he watched rioters broke into it again and burned it to the rubbles. He watched until the cameras burned and the feed stopped.  Chicago Lake Family Dental had been eagerly gearing up to open its doors to patients once again after the COVID-19 stay at home orders.Now the office is facing a new and bigger challenge. Dr. Ali opened his clinic in this location, in the heart of South Minneapolis, because he wanted to serve the neighborhood. Dr. Ali and his wife have two beautiful young daughters, and he was passionate about ensuring that other children had the same access to quality care as his daughters. His clinic had a dedicated kid’s play area, that he created to help kids not only get access to quality care, but to make the experience of visiting the dentist an enjoyable one. The clinic is one of a handful of critical access dental providers in the southside community, providing dental care for undeserved, underprivileged, children and uninsured patients. The surrounding community will suffer with the loss of this community resource, as access to affordable dental care is already a challenge for many in urban and underprivileged areas like this one. Donations will be used to help the dental staff and their families, as they are now without jobs, and will be used to rebuild the clinic as soon as possible, so that they can get back to work in serving the community. Please show those who want to destroy our great city and its resources that they won’t win.  Dr. Ali is very grateful and humbled by the support shown so far. Many volunteers have shown up and helped with cleaning, and the generous financial donations are incredibly helpful and appreciated during this time.  Thank you!Click on or copy the link and paste it in your browser to watch the office coverage by CBS News at 2:44:https://www.cbsnews.com/video/authorities-suspect-white-supremacists-and-far-left-extremists-are-behind-violence-at-protests/%23x""> https://www.cbsnews.com/video/authorities-suspect-white-supremacists-and-far-left-extremists-are-behind-violence-at-protests/#xhttps://www.cbsnews.com/video/authorities-suspect-white-supremacists-and-far-left-extremists-are-behind-violence-at-protests/#xDr. Barbarawi's interview by Fox News: https://news.yahoo.com/minneapolis-dental-clinic-picked-clean-123721383.htmlVisit us at: https://www.chicagolakedental.com/"
Business,Keep the Lights On at Sierra Theaters,"Grass Valley, CA",81378.0,75850.0,131,1K,4.9K,"A thriving small-town community deserves great theaters, access to first-run movies and indie gems, world-class opera, plays and ballet. But, Grass Valley’s beloved movie theaters, Sierra Cinemas, Del Oro Theatre and Sutton Cinemas are on the verge of going dark for good. After three bleak months of lockdown, the Del Oro Theatre reopened on June 26, but was shuttered again by order of the Governor a mere 16 days later. This 41-year-old, family run, independent movie theater business may not make it through the fall and will be another victim of COVID-19 without our community’s support.The stimulus loans we received were not nearly enough to make up for COVID’s ongoing disruption, and that money will run out very soon. Our family has invested a lifetime to bring movies to the community we love, every day of the year at a fair ticket price. We started out at the Nevada Theatre in 1979 as a Sunday night film series. Over the decades, this mom and pop enterprise developed into a thriving community institution, bringing the best in the world of cinema to our small towns. Now, we need your help.We need to raise $151,700 to make it through 2020 and come back strong in 2021. Everyday we look for funding sources and strategize ways we can keep the doors open. Without raising these funds, our doors will close. Will you consider a gift to keep our doors open and popcorn popping so Nevada County can continue to go out to the movies?Your generosity today will not only support this business, but support jobs and the local economy: ●      Sierra Theaters contribute $1.1 million dollars a year to our local economy in wages, purchases from local businesses, contractors, services, local taxes and more.●      Closing Sierra Theaters means losing a staple of our cultural life, and it’s hard to imagine Grass Valley without the iconic Del Oro Theatre.●      Our theaters have supported numerous local organizations over the years by donating thousands of free movie passes and hosting successful annual fundraisers for the Sierra Nevada Memorial Hospital Foundation, South Yuba River Citizens League, and many other local non-profits.●      We serve our youth through Big Brothers/Big Sisters, partnering with our schools, and running the Summer Kids Movie Series. ●      We gave hundreds of teenagers their first job, and we’ve witnessed the blossoming of countless friendships among our young staff. ●      And, our audiences come to town to see a movie, but they also visit nearby shops and enjoy meals and drinks in local restaurants and bars. When you need an escape, a diversion, a date, a night out, a thrill, a laugh, or a couple hours alone – the movie theaters have always been here for you. We know we’ll have to restructure our business going forward to respond to the disruption affecting us all, and we’re looking hard at all our options. We need your support now to help provide the time we need.Please give what you can. In closing, we’d like to acknowledge the generosity of the Nevada County Relief Fund which granted us $5,000 to pay our summer electric bills. This community is awesome, and we’re committed to continue reinvesting in it.  We will donate a portion of the funds collected in this fund drive back to the Relief Fund to keep the dollars circulating. As you know, we’re all in this together.We know you all have fond memories of and connections to the movie theaters in our community and we would love it if you would leave a comment to share those happy memories. Thank you so much for your support to keep this cultural and economic engine running!   - Azriel & Michael LaMarca, Mike & Barbara Getz    Repairing Neon on the Del Oro Tower, February 2020New Seats installed upstairs at Del Oro Theatre, February 2020Del Oro Staff ready to serve July, 2020Sierra Cinemas Lobby Re-Model 2017Detail of painted ceiling at Del Oro Theatre"

Mary and Harold Huss created the Plaza Sauce recipe in 1963 that is still being enjoyed today. The business was passed to their children Tom, Kathy, Peg and Jim in the mid 80’s. The current owner Dean Hetue started working for the family in 1980. Both Erica DeRosa and Ian Miller started In the mid 90’s and were in the process of taking the reigns of ownership when the impact of COVID-19 derailed the business.      With limited or no indoor/outdoor seating, the revenue from carry and delivery food is a fraction of The Plaza’s overhead. Any funds created will First cover the basic monthly costs of being open. As restrictions ease and The Plaza can open more to the public, any funds received will help with hiring new staff until a time the business can sustain itself.  

   Dean, Erica and Ian have been volunteering their time without pay  to continue serving the Plaza food so many have grown to love. While they are committed to keeping the tradition alive, this isn’t sustainable for an extended  period of time. Financial help has come from many of the wonderful regulars and friends, and has been greatly appreciated and needed. Go Fund Me will hopefully add the broader reach needed to make it through this difficult spot in Plaza history. 

       The Plaza needs your help to remain alive. Whether you donate yourself or send the link to all your friends, you can’t imagine how much it is appreciated. Thank you for being part of The Plaza legacy!"
Business,Malibu’s Burgers Restaurant,"Oakland, CA",79147.0,75000.0,168,179,467,"Malibu’s Burgers is a Black-owned vegan food business that specializes in fast food. It was founded by Darren Preston in 2019, and launched as a food truck in January 2020 based out of Oakland, California. We offer plant-based alternatives to classic burger joint favorites: burgers, shakes, and fries. Through our food, we hope to promote how delicious and comforting plant-based diets can be. We are firm believers that if more people were to incorporate more plant-based products into their diets, this would be the first step towards making the world a better place. 

With this Go Fund Me, you will help us move into a permanent location so that we can use our resources to help our communities. With a lack of Black vegan businesses and a quickly growing number of closing Black businesses here in Oakland, Malibu’s Burgers will be more than just a restaurant; Malibu’s Burgers will strive to be a platform for change. With your help, we can make this change happen together. Funding would do more than just help open a brick and mortar; it would be the stepping stone to help our communities. We plan to employ those who need it the most, pay competitively and become a positive staple in the Oakland community. Moreover, Malibu’s Burgers is often contacted by local organizations to help feed youth and homeless, but our current set-up does not allow us to meet the demand that is often requested. This would change working out of a permanent location. Once we have access to a bigger and stable kitchen, we will partner with local organizations to feed the less fortunate and youth in our communities. Our goal is making vegan alternatives accessible to all people. Veganism represents kindness, love and health. It should not be reserved for only those who can afford it. We also promise to help another entrepreneur with their start-up in order to pay forward what has been given to us.

This is the American spirit. This is the type of hard work that exemplifies the spirit of an entrepreneur. This is Arete in action! I know that because of his will to win, DeShawn will be successful with or without donations, but how amazing would it be to jump-start his business with equipment that matches his work ethic? We would be beyond grateful for your support to DeShawn, a young, relentlessly hardworking entrepreneur who has showed he will stop at nothing to serve his community and keep his business alive. Thank you so much for your consideration!

It is reminiscent of a 1920’s soda fountain conjuring up the nostalgia of ice cream when you were a kid with decadent shakes, malts, sundaes and root beer floats served in glassware by the soda jerks making waffle cones behind the counter. It’s THE place where you meet up with friends, go on a date, and bring your kids for a special treat. However it is all at risk.I’m Connie Brown, the owner and founder of The Brown Cow Ice Cream Parlor in Forest Park, IL and I need your help to build an in-house Creamery for The Brown Cow so that we can stay open. For the last 16 years, I worked with an outside company to help manufacture my homemade recipes. With no notice, the company closed its doors to us due to the pandemic…effective immediately! The Brown Cow only has enough ice cream on hand to last just 6 weeks!! I am already running out of inventory. Help us bring back our beloved flavors like Chocolate Peanut Butter and Mint Chocolate Chip.I am a single mom of three teenagers and this is our livelihood.  Since March, I have pivoted to keep my business relevant and vibrant. I serve our customers safely out a newly built walk-up window and we set up a quaint patio to provide the same incredible service. We moved our birthday parties to an awesome online format, kept our bakers busy by baking for the local food pantry and opened the doors to other businesses who needed a certified kitchen/home from which to work. It has been my dream to manufacture our ice cream in-house so that all my customers can watch it be made and be part of the process. To have ice cream camps where you can create your own flavors, etc. I have been planning and budgeting for years, however this needs to be a reality much sooner than I ever expected.  Doing so would lower my costs and increase profit margins in the long-run.  With your help, I can be up and running within 6-8 weeks. I need $50,000 to purchase equipment to make our beloved ice cream in-house. This includes a Batch Freezer (ice cream maker) which runs about $40,000 and help toward the purchase of a Blast Freezer/ Hardening Cabinet ($38,000) and walk in refrigerator ($10,000) The entire build out and equipment will be about $120,000. Some of which I have saved and some of which I can most likely borrow. However, there is no possible way I can cover all these costs. Please help me continue to create memories for my customers who come to the BC - their home for home-made ice cream.Thank you in advance for your ongoing support and generosity. Every penny will go to The Brown Cow Ice Cream Parlor for this purpose.Connie Brown and The Brown Cow team."

Back then, used bookstores in the neighborhood were the norm. Now, we’re the last of the old guard. And we want to go on, but the future is unsure and our ongoing debts are real.During the months we were closed, people knocked on our window every day.  Here’s what one of our neighbors wrote:Zadie Smith (Author of White Teeth and Swing Time among others)“Without exaggeration, if Mercer Street Books closes you might as well just shut down the village and call it a day. It is a centre of culture, a library's reading room, a record store, a tiny gallery (constructed of art book covers) a late-night hang, an autodidact's paradise, the site of the best overhead conversations to be found beneath fourteenth street, and a great place to find out just how little the reviewer who received your latest proof actually read of said proof (spine unbroken; zero notes made.) Without Mercer what's left? Frozen yoghurt? Vegan cupcakes? To do my particular kind of work, these past ten years, I've needed Mercer's like a body needs food. I can't be the only one. Long may it continue!”During the shutdown people shouted through the glass that they wished we could reopen, soon. They told us they missed the browsing. They missed losing themselves in new ideas, new worlds, new lives. These people were from every part of our community: longtime customers, writers, students, faculty, travelers, the people next door. Used bookstores are important. There’s every reason for us to want to stay in business. But there is the debt—months of it. Thus Mercer Street Books would like to raise $97,500.More of our customers had things to say:Ben Kafka (Critic and author of The Demon of Writing: Powers and Failures of Paperwork)“I think it’s Colson Whitehead who says that you’re a true New Yorker when the places that are no longer there feel more real than the ones that are. The old Barnes & Noble on 18th St; 12th Street Books; St Marks Books; that bookstore at 1 University Place; the Strand before they installed air conditioning. We can take this melancholic tour, or one like it, in our minds.“A lot of us are going to be feeling that way a lot in the months and years ahead. So much has been lost, irrevocably, in such a short time. Let’s do what we can to keep Mercer Street Books & Records going. It’s both the shop and the idea of the shop that need rescuing — the New York, and the Greenwich Village, that brought us here, or kept us here, and that keep us going.”Christopher Bram (Author of Surprising Myself and Father of Frankenstein which became the Academy Award winning film Gods and Monsters)“Mercer Street Books & Records is one of the gems of New York, a great shop full of surprises, a time machine that looks back to a past when the city was full of unpredictable stores for real readers. Let's keep this one going into the future. New York City would be a less soulful place without it.”Valerie Steele (Curator of the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology)“Mercer Street Books is a gem - one of the unique stores that makes New York City the cultural center that it is. I feel happy every time I come in - and even happier when I come out, always with some terrific books.”Jeremiah Moss (Author and Blogger of Vanishing New York)“Mercer Street Books is a haven, a consummate ""third space"" where people gather in informal community to discuss politics, the news of the day, and the ideas they're discovering in the books they read. Walking into Mercer Street Books is like walking into a social club that is open to anyone who comes through the door. To lose it would be to lose another piece of New York's rebellious soul.”That is what the people around us are saying about Mercer Street Books & Records.Dare we say that a bookstore is like an ancient temple to ideas? We think so, and hope you think so as well. But the temple must stand. That's why we are asking for your support right now. We all hope the books and the ideas will continue to flow for years from Mercer Street Books."
Business,Sustain Community Jail Support in Philly!,"Philadelphia, PA",82324.0,75000.0,137,1K,633,"“We, as formerly incarcerated people, deserve the right to take care of our own community. In this moment, we are asking that folks who care about this movement, and who have been energized by the protests and Movement For Black Lives, help us to ensure that this business and service to the community is sustained beyond our present moment. Everyone being released from jail deserves a safe ride to where they need to be, and it is the responsibility of those who are not directly impacted by the racist and violent police and prison system to support and empower those of us who have been doing this work for years so we can continue to do it safely and effectively. This work is life saving to us—not only for the individuals we’re providing help to on State Road, but to all of us who are directly impacted that are able to work together to build a better future for ourselves and our community.” 

-Goldenrod Drivers 

Background 

For much of the past nine years, Brian Watson, a formerly-incarcerated Black man, has spent his days waiting with his van next to the bus stop on State Road in Philadelphia. This bus stop is where people being released from jail are dropped off after being held at any of the four detention centers along this stretch of road. Brian greets each person with understanding, as someone who has experienced incarceration himself. Brian, facing many employment obstacles as a formerly-incarcerated person, has been able to generate a small amount of income providing safe and often free rides home to those being released.  

If you’ve never been to State Road, it is severely disconnected from public transportation. Further, since the pandemic, it has not even been possible to get Lyfts and other ride shares to come to the bus stop. Brian’s service is often the only means home for many people who have been released.  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brian has teamed up with LaTonya Myers from the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund. This partnership allows PCBF to better meet the needs of the community members that they are bailing out and supporting, as well as provides Brian with more stable income for his services a couple days a week.  

However, this arrangement has been complicated by recent events. In the wake of George Floyd's death and related protests, the Philly community stepped up to support those being bailed out of jail by offering free rides home from State Road. Though we are grateful for the community's support, this disrupted the work Brian has been doing to care for those coming home and the foundation that he built for his community to be supported by those who are most impacted by the Prison Industrial Complex. When well-meaning efforts are out of touch with pre-existing community-led infrastructure, harm occurs. Brian’s work should not only be protected from this harm, it should be further uplifted. Brian and his comrades are a source of care and a beacon of hope for those coming home. As a community, we need to support Brian the same way he has supported those coming home for the last nine years.  

To make this happen Brian, Chris Wimberly, and a growing team will need $150,000 to provide full-time jail support, including free rides home, at $30/hr for two years. PCBF and Philadelphia Bail Fund will each pitch in substantial funds towards that goal. This fundraiser is working to raise the remaining amount needed to make this dream possible. Any funds raised over the goal will allow this partnership to continue farther into the future. Brian has now teamed up with Goldenrod Transportation, a company owned and operated by Denise Alexander, a formerly incarcerated Black woman. Denise has provided this endeavor with the administrative support it needs to thrive and grow into the future. This fundraiser is to secure a salary for both Brian and the other formerly incarcerated drivers hired by Goldenrod for this work.  

Drivers provide those being released with information about resources, pertinent hotline numbers, a mask, hand sanitizer, and a free ride to wherever they need to go. Our drivers also provide access to their phones so people can call their loved ones. All drivers receive training from LaTonya Myers, the Support Coordinator for the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund. We prioritize trans and gender nonconforming folx, women, and those with medical or mental health issues.  

A sweet reunion on State Road! 

What is jail support, and why is it important?

When an incarcerated person is released, they are usually either dropped off at a bus stop or even just sent out from a side or back gate. They may not have money to get home, or a means of transportation. They may be wounded, thirsty, or hungry. They may be disoriented or traumatized. They may not have anywhere to go. They may have been in jail for a day, or in prison for decades. Jail support is a vital, two-part practice: the first part is tracking, which means finding out where people who were arrested were taken, and calling to check in on their bail hearing and arraignment, i.e. when they get charged, and if they’ll need bail. This aspect of jail support is usually carried out by bail funds, criminal justice advocates and legal collectives. The second part is providing a comforting, well-resourced presence to folks who have just been released, regardless of if they were on a bail fund’s list of people to expect. Jail support must be trauma-informed and adaptable to each releasee’s emotional state and immediate needs. It can look many ways, but includes: celebrating as folks get released, offering moral support; holding space for the person to feel whatever they are feeling about their ordeal; providing food, water, medical attention if needed, and sanitation supplies and PPE in the COVID-19 era. Once they are comfortable, jail support connects the individual to any necessary legal services, or other needed services such as housing, or in these times, a place to quarantine. Lastly and vitally, effective jail support offers a safe, hassle-free ride to the destination of their choice. Without this support, our community members are left to fend for themselves. 

Maybe you learned about jail support recently because of the arrests in connection with the Uprisings. Perhaps you have known for a long time about this vital work supporting people as they are released from jail. Regardless, jail support is not just a need that pops up with mass arrests during demonstrations. It is a mutual aid practice with a long history in Black and brown communities. To be done well and respectfully, it must be grounded in community connection. In addition to the services outlined above, jail support means understanding who is missing in the community; finding people inside the jail system; letting families know that their loved ones are accounted for; making sure folks inside know that they are not forgotten and that community is here to support them when they are released; and finally, showing up to keep that promise. Releasees have just come through a traumatizing experience, designed to dehumanize and isolate. Whether they are a protester, someone surviving in street economies, someone in need of mental health support, or someone arrested just for living while Black, everyone deserves to be welcomed out with emotional and physical support and nourishment, a ride home to somewhere safe, and resources to face whatever legal battle lies ahead. In a world that refuses to acknowledge that crime is the result of failing societal structures much more than any individual’s actions, all prisoners are political prisoners."

Feathers has been a staple of the LGBTQ+ community for 42 years. We have been home to thousands of people both patrons and entertainers, but times have changed. Feathers is now in danger of closing permanently. We have been closed for 4 months with no income due to the pandemic. We have struggled to stay afloat through this terrible time. As time goes on and with all the restrictions placed on us by the government for the safety and health of all of us, it has become clear that without everyone’s help we may have to close the doors forever.

Feathers opened its doors on June 21st,1978 when being gay was not widely accepted. We opened so that our community could have a safe place to call our own, we have championed for social acceptance and equality. We are the longest-running gay club still in existence in NJ today and only one of a few left. In good times and bad, Feathers has been the place to go. We have all laughed, danced, partied, and cried together as a community in this place we call home.



The Covid-19 global pandemic has taken so much from all of us. We now live in a changed reality and the future is hard to imagine without Feathers. Today, we are asking you to help save Feathers from closing its doors forever. We are facing an uncertain future and the road to recovery will be long and tough. Without your support, we will face a very bleak future.

Through my initiative, Nourish In Black (formerly known as #ChopItUpATL), I orchestrate beautiful, healing, dialogue-based gatherings. Through this platform, I seek to honor storytelling, art, and cultural foodways.I have firsthand experience with food injustice, spending part of my childhood in a food insecure neighborhood in South Florida. In 2013, I launched an art and retail business that evolved to include a food justice based event initiative, Nourish In Black. This initiative highlights Atlanta’s food justice organizations and the farm community. Using the artistry of floral and interior design, I began to create dinner parties and brunches under my brand, featuring panel-based dialogue surrounding art, gentrification, food sovereignty and justice issues. Artful healing through nourishment is central to every event I’ve ever created. As of today, I have organized twenty four dinner parties with facilitated conversations focusing on food justice and art. My Collective Impact Dinner’s, hosted from 2018-2019, focused on fundraising for local black-led food justice organizations. I am the co-creator of the Simmer Down Picnic series launched in 2016, bringing over two thousand people together and supporting thirty eight budding entrepreneurs such as Two Dough Girls and 95th St Tacos. Most recently, I launched Friends and Neighbors Day Fest in 2019 bringing together fifteen hundred people to encourage marginalized people to heal while playing in green spaces. I have also been featured in Creative Loafing , Melanin and Sustainable Style  and Politico Magazine.Maurice SmallMaurice Small is a farmer, trainer of farmers, soil alchemist and worm whisperer in Atlanta, Georgia.

Maurice is a founding and active member of the Farmer x Farmer Coalition.A Black Owned Green Space Dedicated to Health + WellnessWhy This Space Is Important“Food justice is racial justice. Food and agriculture, like everything in this country, are deeply intertwined with our nation’s entrenched history of slavery and structural racism. Our food system actively silences, marginalizes, and disproportionately impacts people of color, who are also being hardest hit by COVID-19.” - Civil Eats EditorsAlso, while cities across the United States have been implementing environmental policies that have led to the rapid growth of green spaces—parks, community gardens, wilderness areas and urban agriculture—public spaces remain contested ground. Many green spaces are often as segregated as our cities, with the barriers keeping black and brown residents from accessing public space being both visible and invisible. As planners, business-people, city leaders, policymakers, and residents, how can we confront the legacies of violence and exclusion, support and empower those directly affected, and create safe and accessible places that offer social, economic, and recreational opportunities for all?There is both food disparity and disparity within our green spaces for our black community. We hope to become a destination that represents a beacon of change for both of these injustices through creating conversation, sharing stories, educational programming and providing a platform for leadership in the fight against these injustices. CommunityAccording to Food Well Alliance’s 2017 Baseline Report , one in four metro Atlanta families with children are food insecure, three out of four metro Atlanta adults do not consume the recommended 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetable daily and one in three metro Atlanta adults are obese. These numbers are shameful, but what’s more staggering is how much food is being wasted. “Based on the most recent data available, food residuals makes up 12 percent – or more than 800,000 tons – of the waste sent to Georgia landfills each year, with approximately 48% coming from the greater Atlanta area. This represents the largest single category of solid waste going into Georgia's landfills.” - EPA . ThinkTable’s plan is to rescue and use surplus produce from local farms and food food producers in the Nourish Botanica kitchen and as artisanal canned and preserved products to be sold at Nourish Botanica, thereby diverting the food from being wasted.Our community plan is intended as a cross pollinator that continues to invest in the community through a collective impact approach that includes growers, artists, policy makers and corporate partnerships. Nourish In Black will continue to create an opportunities to highlight growers, grassroots food justice organizers, food producers and creative entrepreneurs.Nourish In Black has raised over $5,000 for grassroots food justice organizations through our dinner parties, and another $2,500 most recently to feed protestors by purchasing from black businesses through our Nourish The People popup, but it's not just about dollars, it's about important dialogue and visual representation.With a physical space we can continue into our eighth year by bringing even more people together for dinners, brunches and life changing conversation. We can continue education on food apartheid, fundraising for food justice organizations and decolonizing the food system by returning to our ancestral knowledge. With our own space, we would finally be the owners of our own narrative while creating an amazing gathering space for our Atlanta community to assemble for change. Built into our business model, is the ability to donate the space to non-profit organizations and community members for like-minded events or gatherings by application on a monthly basis.

The Pet Place offers a full-line of high quality supplies, exceptional customer service, special and custom orders, referrals and information, problem-solving, nutritional counseling, and much more. For the past 28 years, we have assisted in finding homes for thousands of animals, reunited pets, hosted weekly adoption fairs, petitioned for numerous advocacy issues, have raised funds and awareness for local/state/world-wide disaster relief, and have made donations to many different organizations. We also support individuals who care daily for homeless animals, which includes rescue, feeding, spay/neuter, and finding forever homes.    The city of Menlo Park named us business of the year, giving us the prestigious Golden Acorn Award for professional excellence and community service. We were the recipient of Pet Product News Magazine's U.S. Retailer of the year award for community service and also were voted favorite pet supply in 34 newspaper polls.    In the past few years, the internet has severely impacted our business. Maintaining competitive prices, increasing costs, and high rent have also caused financial hardship. Since we are not a corporation or funded by venture capitalists... just a husband/wife team, local and independent... we have had to use our savings to survive, all with the hope things would turn around.     We find ourselves in a difficult and humbling position. We have always been there to help others, now we need help. In early March, before the pandemic, we had set a retirement date for June 30th, and signed the lease extension. Then, a short time after that the virus shutdown hit. It is absolutely crushing us. Even though we were able to stay open as an essential business, there has been a huge loss of income... paying full rent ($16,000/month) for those months, employee wages, regular overhead and maintenance, etc., while struggling with the lowest sales in our history.    The pandemic is making the store closure a logistical and financial nightmare. We are very worried because we were counting on liquidation to replenish our depleted savings, to pay bills, and to cover closing costs. There is also the concern about even being able to sell inventory, fixtures, slatwall, equipment, etc. at this time. Also, the close-out sale will be adversely affected by the social distancing restrictions.    We are at an impasse... we cannot afford to stay in business, and at the same time, The Pet Place has been our life and our passion. On the other hand, we have worked 28 years, six, sometimes seven, days a week without a vacation. We have given as much as we can for as long as we can... we are worn out. It is time.    We have made so many friends, seen families grow-up, and have shared laughter and tears. We have a love affair with our customers, two and four legged and we will treasure the time we had together and all the wonderful memories.     We have always taken great pride in helping our customers. It has been an honor to serve the community. We feel very fortunate to have this profound connection. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support.    Hug and play with your animals as much as possible. Stay well, we will dearly miss you all.     Lynn and Marc Macy, and The Pet Place staff.                                               ""Until one has loved an animal,                                              a part of one's soul remains                                              unawakened""  Anatole France"

Thanks to the amazing fundraiser we held in June, we raised enough money to put down a security deposit on a new space and secure the future of Bluestockings just a few blocks away at 116 Suffolk St in the Lower East Side!We couldn’t have done this without the support of our sustaining members who have helped keep us afloat during this pandemic. With that said, we have a lot of work ahead of us to make our new location into a home for our queer, trans, and SWing family. We need your support in making this possible, and here’s what you’d be helping us build:A larger, more accessible place to read, eat, and be in community with each other. Our new space is more than double the size of 172 Allen Street! Accessibility needs are at the forefront of our plans when designing the new space, with a fully ADA-compliant bathroom, expanded café seating, lower café countertops, clear exit paths and wider aisles. We are excited to have more space and need your help to install a platform lift in our cafe area to make sure that our disabled comrades are able to take full advantage of the space. This extra room also gives us the opportunity to have a much needed area dedicated exclusively to events and meetings for our friends who run book clubs, labor organizers, and anyone else who utilizes Bluestockings as a hub for radical thought. A much needed technological upgrade.One of the major issues we have come up against over the years is our very outdated software system. This has made it especially hard to keep up with online orders! To make sure that this isn’t an obstacle going forward, we plan to reopen with a new POS and inventory system to make ordering from Bluestockings as easy as possible. Help us build a new home!In order to build our new home and keep providing vital resources to our queer, trans, and SWing community, we are raising 150K. Help us build a beautiful space and secure our future in the LES!"
Business,Wally's Cafe Jazz Student to Student Music Project,"Boston, MA",52010.0,50000.0,175,905,2K,"A note from Wally’s,We hope everyone is safe and healthy. The Walcott/Poindexter family appreciates those who have reached out to find ways to support Wally’s during the coronavirus pandemic. We have received numerous questions about how the business can be supported, so we created a GoFundMe page. About us: Wally's Café Jazz Club was established on January 1, 1947, in Boston, Massachusetts, becoming the first black-owned jazz club in New England. The nightclub is located at the famed intersection of Massachusetts and Columbus Avenues in the South End. Wally's Café, formally known as “Wally’s Paradise” played a major role in introducing jazz to the New England community upon its establishment. Our doors have been closed for almost three months; the longest time in our 73 year history. We are one of ten black-owned liquor license holders in Boston and we pride ourselves in being open 365 days a year. We hope to open as soon as it is safe to do so; we are prioritizing everyone’s health and safety during these tough times. Our mission:We are seeking financial support to financially recover from the coronavirus pandemic and to develop a new initiative called “The Student to Student Music Café” and a production facility. As some of you may know, it has been our hope to expand Wally’s Cafe into the building next door. The production facility will allow musicians to network and practice their craft, while simultaneously providing them with the tools to digitally stream their performances. Our goal is to have the production facility function as space for musicians to create podcasts, provide music lessons, and to collaborate with each other. We live in a digital world and we want to continue to connect with our international customer base.  Final thoughts:We hope to continue our tradition of providing live music and a place for musicians and music lovers to share a space for years to come. With love,Wally’s Cafe Jazz Club"

Any donations now in excess of this $25,000 will not go to the corporation but instead will go directly to Alima Bonsa for her legal expenses. Alima held a press conference on June 18th telling of her harrowing experience of having been kidnapped and trafficked from her small village in Burkina Faso, West Africa, forced into a marriage in 2001 and brought to the United States. She is now in need of legal representation against her trafficker who is attempting to take custody of her 3 children. Thank you to all for the outpouring of support. Please be patient with us regarding the rewards as we are very busy with many aspects of this case. We will honor all rewards and in the meantime know that all of your contributions have been deeply felt with gratitude by Alima and those of us who care about and love her.ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN: After three years of Alima's Cuisine serving delicious Burkina Faso West African food out of tents at farmers' markets and pop-up restaurants, Alima is ready to step things up with a food truck! She has found a truck which needs some mechanical work as well as kitchen refurbishment. She has researched all of the necessary permits and paperwork. She has a wonderful logo designed! She has her great food and many return customers.  She, along with her amazing mother/business associate are hard-working upbeat women who know how to please the palate. Alima is translating her amazing fortitude into gaining all kinds of entrepreneurial energy and know-how so that she can well-provide for her three wonderful children as a single mother. Now she only needs to raise the funds for the purchase, auto repairs  and refurbishing of the food truck into a working nomadic kitchen. Once the food truck is ready, Alima's Cuisine will be able to serve the recipes handed down from her ancestors not only at farmers' markets, but also on busy streets, at baseball games and other gatherings (once gathering is safe again.) We shall also create a website for the business from which orders can be taken.We have organized a series of rewards based on donations, but please donate any amount you wish. Even small donations of $5 or $10 add up and will help.

Since 1974, the Dixie Chicken has remained timeless – generations of Aggies, Texans, and visitors have walked through the same swinging doors for a great burger or a cold beer.

For over 40 years the ""Chicken"" has never closed. Through finals, game days and holidays we have welcomed all to the experience of a real Texas honky tonk. However, for us along with many Texans and Americans,  2020 has been a rough year. After closing for Covid19 concerns, the Dixie Chicken remained confident of its continued service to its loyal customers.

We recently reopened with limited capacity. But 2020 wasn't done. After storms and torrential rains pounded College Station on May 27, the roof of the Dixie Chicken collapsed. 

For assistance with repairs and more loss of business, we could sure use a little help keeping this Aggie Family tradition alive. If you have raised a pitcher, enjoyed a Freddy burger, or a domino game on the back porch, help us with our goal and we'll get back up and running and keeping our tradition Strong.

Business,Help HiDeHo recover & Club for Marginilized Geeks,"Santa Monica, CA",49069.0,99999.0,177,823,7.3K,"Hi De Ho Comics has been a fixture of Santa Monica for 43 years, making us the oldest comic book store in Los Angeles Country. Our other location, Geoffrey's Comics in Gardena is the second oldest. So to say that we have a passion for the medium is a bit of an understatement.Geoff Patterson, owner:I love comic books. I really really love them. I truly believe that world would be a better place if everyone read more Superman—it changes you for the better.In the midst of this shutdown I read an issue where Superman saves a young woman by hugging her and tells her ""You're much stronger than you think you are"". As the father of a newborn daughter, it broke me. I wept for the lives lost and the lives yet to be lost, saddened by my feelings of helplessness. I kept hearing Superman saying  ""You're much stronger than you think you are""  and frankly, as silly as this may sound, I didn’t want to let Superman down. I knew deep inside that we can each make a difference, so I called the Red Cross to volunteer both of our stores as blood drive locations. Details forthcoming.And because Superman believes that we’re all stronger than we know, I’ll even be overcoming my crybaby fears and donating for the first time.If I close my eyes and think of the word ""home"", the image that comes to mind is the comic book store my dad started 40 years ago in Gardena, literally living in the back room with my mother. Taking over Hi De Ho Comics and adding my father’s name to it felt like the perfect way to honor his memory while respecting the shop’s history and its commitment to Santa Monica’s community that original owners Mark and Bob Hennessey worked so hard to create. I want Hi De Ho Comics to retain the same spirit it had when it opened in 1977.Much like the Avengers heed the call, my closest friends and allies came and partnered with me to purchase Hi De Ho Comics and do justice to its legacy. My Partners were some of my oldest friends - Eddie deAngelini, and Kristen Parraz. The way Eddie and Kristen have made the store their own and connected with the community has been nothing short of astounding­—driven by the belief that comics are for everyone.Kristen quickly applied over 20 years of non-profit experience to create an open and inviting environment that embraces women and marginalized groups, highlighting books with diverse characters and creators.Eddie brought his creativity and love for comics to help make the store a safe space for all, spearheading in-store events like Hi De Ho Comics SaMo PRIDE Con that provided LGBTQ+ creators a platform to share their work. With our previous location falling into disrepair, we wanted to give Hi De Ho Comics a new lease on life. As such, we worked hard to make a big move to our present 412 Broadway location, closer to the 3rd Street Promenade.Kristen Parraz, co-owner:Like many small businesses, the Covid-19 shutdown has impacted us tremendously. Closing our doors at the height of tourist season resulted in the biggest financial hit in our 40+ year history.To make matters worse, our store was broken into on May 31st by thieves using the peaceful protest of the day as cover. Our door was literally drilled into until the lock fell off.Once inside, cases of the Magic: The Gathering product Ikoria (with special Godzilla cards!) were stolen, wiping out what should have lasted us for months in a matter of minutes.Toys and statues were taken throughout the store, our custom glass cases were flipped over and/or had their glass broken out. Fixtures were tossed around and product strewn across the floor. Both of our cash registers were smashed and the computer we rely on to run our POS system was damaged, making it difficult to get in contact with our customers.When the looters got to the back room they found multiple boxes of valuable Golden, Silver, and Bronze age comic books. Everything from 70s Spider-Man to 60s X-Men to 50s Superman. Even the World War II era superhero Bulletman and his dog, Bulletdog! (Yes, that was really the dog's name) Those boxes are gone. Along with the Magic cards, and the toys, and the doorknob, and the statues. But we aren't gone. Our employees were safely at home - they are ok.  We are ok.Our store is a small business trying to survive in an area of Santa Monica priced up for global mega-brands. We have been making our way, but not many small stores can handle the loss of over $40,000 in product anywhere, let alone here.The money from this go fund me will not only to replace our lost product and paying all of our employees, as we have been waiting for our approved PPP loan to clear for over a month now. We will also put funds towards replacing and refurbishing parts of our building, a state landmark (Popeye the Sailor was literally created in our building! How cool is that?!). Likewise, we will be replacing all of the custom fixtures that were destroyed.And because what’s happening in the world is much larger than just what has happened to us, we will be donating 10% of all donations to the BINC Comic Book Store Safety Fund, which funds comic book stores hit financially during the current economic downturn. A further 10% of all funds will be donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center which is dedicated to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of our society.Even with everything that has happened within our shop and outside of it, we would never lash out at our brothers in fear and anger. The X-Men taught us that. We still stand with peaceful protesters the world over. You are our brothers and sisters and we cry out for justice with you.********UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE*********************From everyone at Hi De Ho Comics, thank you for all of your love and support. We are truly living the end of It’s a Wonderful Life, surrounded by friends and allies who have come to our rescue in our time of need. It’s because of you that we have reached our initial fundraising goal. No man is poor who has friends—and boy, do we have amazing friends. After the initial shock of reaching our goal in five days had set in we began to ask ourselves “What do we do next?”We have a platform and an army of customers, creators, and well-wishers who continue to ask how they can help. Some people are still continuing to donate. So, what should we do with this energy and the additional funds?The answer was always going to be the same: Give back to the community.We’ve decided that every single penny that we collect above the 10% to BINC, the 10% to Southern Poverty Law and the fees on our original request will go toward starting a new program that will seek to elevate the voices of marginalized comic creators throughout Los Angeles County. If we can reach 10k above our goal and fees - The Los Angeles Comic Book Collective would span both of our locations, from Gardena to Santa Monica, and would seek to accomplish the following:Provide a comfortable, productive space for creators from all walks of life to meet and work on their art.Provide professional level supplies including, but not limited to, blank pages, inks, and markers to creators of all ages, from 2 to 102.Invite professional creators of color and other marginalized groups to participate in virtual and live speeches and Q+As.Share and record educational meetings as an on online library of lessons.Sharing completed portfolios of local artists with our contacts in the comic book publishing industry.And not to be limited to just comic books, the Collective will also help us upgrade our current gaming space to be used as a safe place for everyone to play all the games that we all love. Additionally, funds could also be used to help minority and marginalized game creators bring their vision to life, with our store as a free testing ground for their ideas.If we can raise $5,000 more after that, the Collective would provide a free-to-rent podcast space for members to amplify their voices. This in addition to having podcasters of color provide seminars on how to produce one’s own show.And with $5,000 more and some hard work, we would pursue publishing of an anthology collection made up entirely of minority and under-represented comic book creators.And finally – we have our big swing idea. We want to create a book-mobile for the Los Angeles Comic Collective. If we can raise $30,000 more we will put all of that money into a book mobile that can take free books and games to any and every school in Los Angeles county that will have us. We will bring speakers of color and underrepresented minorities to these schools to talk about their jobs in the arts. We will bring these students the same safe space to create as our stores, but in a way that increases our accessability to everyone in Los Angeles more than opening 10 more locations would. We know that to raise up the voices that we want to help raise – accessibility becomes a major issue. Our book-mobile can bring our message and our art to anyone that needs to hear it.With your help, we can build something that stands the test of time and continually gives back to the community. The Collective would follow in the history of the creative communities at both Geoffrey’s Comics and Hi De Ho Comics—which fostered talents of all races and backgrounds—and counts Danny Miki, Karl Altstaetter, Joe Keatinge, John Singleton, Norm Rapmund, and Sina Grace as their alums.Superheroes were very literally created to give a voice to minorities and the under-represented. We are excited to have you join us in our mission to help continue the legacy of a medium built for ALL of us."

And the reality is we do need help retiring our debt and supporting our employees who no longer have a livelihood at Bella Luna & The Milky Way.   In 2009 we moved our business from 405 Centre Street to 284 Amory Street due to a huge rent increase.  That relocation, the build-out of our new space, and the interest on those loans, cost over $1,000,000.  We have been working since then to pay off that debt.  We were expecting to make our final loan payment next year in 2021.  Our abrupt closing on March 16, 2020 has left us owing the remaining balance on our bank loan plus over two hundred thousand dollars to vendors, many of whom are small local businesses.   So we are launching our “Bella Luna 27” campaign to raise $75,000 to help retire this debt.  We ask you to consider giving $1-$27 for every year that Bella Luna was in operation.  For example, $1/year would be $27, $3/year would be $81, $5/year would be $135, etc.  Your gift will help us retire the debt, and 10% will be distributed directly to our employees to support them during the pandemic.   Any gift amount will be deeply appreciated! This is not how we wanted our story to end.  But we are filled with love and gratitude for the many staff, guests, promoters and partners who helped make our ‘hospitality with a purpose’ a vibrant reality for so many years.Thank you for sharing your memories and stories with us, and thank you for considering helping us at this difficult time.   Best,Kathie, Carol, Megan, Charlie and Pierre"

It has been an enormously challenging and fulfilling journey. We take pride in using the freshest ingredients to cook from scratch for every catering order and for our takeout days. We are a “family to family” business. However Silver Spoon is more than just a business for us, it is how we contribute to the larger community as a part of the tapestry of South Asian art and culture.Silver Spoon has become a precious haven for healthy, wholesome and sustainably sourced food through our catering services and weekly Take-outs. Silver Spoon has been innovative and visionary in that we incorporate Quinoa, Brown rice, oats and other nutritionally relevant greens and millets into traditional Indian food. We shop weekly at our local Sunnyvale and Cupertino farmers markets and buy our produce through organic farms whenever possible. It has been such a privilege to cook for hundreds of weddings, birthdays, graduations and house-warming ceremonies over the decades. We strive to help non-profits whenever possible with our food donations.Most of you may have heard that most food establishments (small businesses) will not survive this pandemic. Due to Coronavirus and shelter in place, all our corporate and wedding catering orders have ceased since March 2020. We have been offering Takeout, however it is not bringing sufficient revenue to compensate for overhead costs of keeping the business open., Our cash reserves have dwindled drastically each month for the last five months. However, we do not want to close our doors. We are doing everything we can to generate other sources of income. Last week, as we kept re-doing our company accounts multiple times, we humbly realized that we need to ask you for help if we are to remain open.   Funds contributed by you would be used immediately for rent, employee paychecks, insurance, utilities, supplies, and business upkeep expenses. We need funds till the end of this year, as by January of 2021 we are very optimistic that our marketing efforts will bear fruit(to allow for more Takeout orders) and event caterings will increase over the coming months. Any contributions, however large or small would be deeply appreciated.

I was surprised and excited to see how many people believe and trust me to begin what will be an exciting development for a city that I love dearly.  Although I have been working in the arts for young people and people of color for 20 years, I think it's time for me to start a space that addresses needs with a new, more inclusive vision of, for, and with long-time South Side residents. Here are some of the things that I'm envisioning:-writing workshops and book clubs-literacy classes-cooking demos-dance classes-tax prep sessions-doula training-technology education for young people (coding, building computers, etc.)-and a space that would be available for small, intimate cultural events and family celebrations. I am asking for your help in purchasing this property and making small renovations. We've already begun steps to purchase this property and talked to investors. If you don't have access to money that folds, jingles, or swipes, please share this campaign widely on social media. If you help get us there, I'll be happy to celebrate when the doors open for our launch celebration.  WATCH.ME.WORK.From the Board:When we came across Tara's Facebook post, we shared in everyone's immediate enthusiasm for this very achievable goal: to bring more community arts and services to Washington Park, led by the genius and love of Dr. Tara Betts. As witnesses of her work in the fields of literature, education, editorial work, and community organizing, we know that she will indeed WORK! We are asking you join us as we support Tara in doing all that she does best in her soon-to-be home of Washington Park, its surrounding neighborhoods, and the South Side. Our goal for a 20% down payment is $50,000.However, in our collective support with you, we can go further. Join #teamnomortgage! We can do this! Let's do this together for Tara and The Whirlwind Center (#WhirlwindCenter).Sincerely,L.D. BarnesNikki PatinAurelius Raines IIJennifer Steele Nell Taylor"

My name is Lance Cooper (activist & business owner) located in Richmond, Virginia. I've created various media/community improvement projects all over the United States with features in Forbes , People , and on GoFundMe. My small business 804 Street Media has lost dozens of clients & a few partners due to the COVID-19 crisis, I've also lost family & friends to the virus. Many know me as a strong Black Lives Matter voice for unity & justice, so it has been a natural call of duty protesting for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and every black life lost to racism. Read my story: It’s 2020 And I Had to Leave My Home & Relocate My Business Because of the KKK As my business continues to take hits I regret nothing, and plan to keep marching for justice until change comes. I'm asking for contributions to help me continue my work as I fight to correct injustices, while trying to save everything I've worked hard to build.How the funds will be spentThe funds will be spent on rebuilding our media network, launching new relief programs around the world, acquiring new building space, and keeping the lights on until things are back to normal. All donations will help 804 Street Media continue to fund & provide the following community + tech projects in Richmond, Virginia and other cities:RVA Community Closet: A network of support and hope, dedicated to assisting, connecting & empowering the world. We are currently providing PPE and helping citizens struggling during COVID-19.RVACC Youth Empowerment: We provide learning programs to improve youth development – including understanding self and personal values, life skills, dealing with racism, family stress, human growth and development, and issues related to social and emotional transitions from adolescence to adulthood.RVA Everybody Eats: This community improvement project is actively involved with feeding the homeless and less fortunate.

My involvement with community work and helping others is the only thing really keeping me together during this chaos. I've never been a quitter, and I hope that people have witnessed enough good in me to help if I ever needed a hand. Upon reaching my goal, any funds received over and above the solicited purposes will be donated to help other families affected by the COVID crisis & other business owners.This campaign is me reaching back hoping someone values me alive & can help us get back to where we once were.

Business,Help for Little Friends,"Greenwich, CT",47666.0,50000.0,78,160,169,"Like so many others, our family business has suffered severe financial damage due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  We recognize how lucky we are to remain in business even as so many other early childhood programs have and will remain closed. The truth is, the financials for these businesses are fragile even in the best of times, with razor thin margins and certainly no cushion for an impact like this pandemic. The cost of doing business is only increasing as our vendors pass along price increases and with each passing month our financial situation worsens. Nonetheless, we face each month with determination and optimism and together with our incredible and loyal family of teachers we know we can come out on the other side of this. Little Friends will turn 15 years old in January and we are so proud and thankful to have been a part of so many young children's incredible and important early years. We want and hope to be here for another 15 years (many more, actually!). But, we have exhausted our available resources and with greatly reduced enrollment for so many months, we realize the time has come when we need to ask for help. We know that this is a challenging time for most families and we will be so grateful for any donation amount and we would appreciate it if you can share our campaign with family and friends who might be able to help Little Friends through this difficult time.  As our wise friend (she doesn't know we are friends) Dolly Parton says, ""you gotta put up with some rain if you want to see a rainbow"".  We know the rainbow is coming and while we are waiting for it, we will be here happily spending our our days in the company of our sweet Little Friends. We hope that you and your families are and remain well. Thank you from the whole LF Family XOXO"
Business,Digital Green Book Website,"Denver, CO",48277.0,100000.0,172,1.1K,3.2K,"Birdwatching. BBQ'ing in a park. Browsing a store. Eating at a restaurant. These activities can be either fun and enjoyable or dangerous and deadly, depending on the color of your skin.In 1936, the first edition of The Negro Traveller’s Green Book was published by a Black man named Victor H. Green, in Harlem, New York. The Green Book provided a directory of Black-friendly businesses, from restaurants to gas stations, mechanics to doctors, so that Black travelers could protect themselves from discomfort and danger by planning ahead.The original Green Book stated, ""The purpose of the Green book is to give the negro traveller information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassment, and to make his trip enjoyable.” It also said, “There will be a time in the future when this guide will not have to be published.” The last print edition was published in 1966-1967, as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination. Unfortunately, as we know all too well, just because something is written into law doesn't necessarily mean it's no longer happening.In 2020, two Black women plan to launch the first nation wide digital version of the Green Book, providing a crowd-sourced database of businesses, parks, restaurants, stores, and towns that Black people can feel safe traveling to and through.It’s like Yelp, but for inclusivity.On this website, users can submit business locations they feel safe in, as well as businesses owned/operated by people of marginalized identities. Users can rate a business on a range of things, such as courtesy of staff, ADA compliance, sense of personal safety as it relates to their identity, gender neutral bathrooms, and more. We take it even further...Also available on our website:- Resources to help businesses self-audit for inclusiveness- Resources to help businesses improve- Referrals to Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity trainers• It’s like if a restaurant listed on Yelp got a bad review for cooking, and  then provided the restaurant with cooking classes to help them become better.• There will be a range of free to paid options for these resources.If we raise enough money, we will be able to increase the intersectionality of this database, to ensure we can provide additional resources for those from other marginalized communities, such as the LGBTQIA+ community, those who need ADA/Accessibility information, and more. The idea-makers behind this, Crystal Egli & Parker McMullen-Bushman, have drafted a sample website and outlined everything they ever dreamed of for its features. However, they are also two women with full time jobs, kids, no web designing experience, and are board members and community organizers as well. The money raised here would go to hiring a Black web designer to help Crystal and Parker see their dream turned into reality. Money raised over our initial $25,000 goal will be dedicated to growing the website and the services and programs it offers.To learn more details about this project, please visit InclusiveJourneys.com.- Crystal & Parker"

The circumstances are out of our control so we’re taking the humbling unusual step of asking our community for help to keep our doors open.The fact that salons have been closed for this long is devastating to our industry and we are starting to see salons permanently close their doors, some who have been open for 30 years. This is heartbreaking- especially when we have invested so much money, time and energy into making our spaces safe and compatible with all guidelines. With masks, shields in between stations, waivers and full time cleaning staff, (and even more to come upon reopening) you are much safer than in any retail or grocery store. With all of that said, we want to make fundraising fun and show our appreciation for your efforts in supporting us during this time.

Business,Keep COFFEESSIONS Alive,"Wheeling, IL",45054.0,45000.0,85,53,375,"Keep COFFEESSIONS AliveIn 2018, I decided to create COFFEESSIONS in the community of Wheeling, Illinois, where I have been raising my kids. My goal was to craft something more than just a neighborhood coffee shop.  I wanted to build a space for human bonding and growth, a venue for locals to respire and enjoy the richness of diversity.  With the theme “locally-rooted but globally-minded” we successfully launched COFFEESSIONS in May of 2019.  With some typical challenges during the first six months, we managed to progressively expand our customer base, mostly from surrounding neighborhoods and local businesses. By January-March of 2020, we were hopeful and excited.  We started holding events every weekend with local bands, showcasing the work of local artists, and bakeries.  COFFEESSIONS was the main venue for social language groups every weekend, our Blu Room and our listening room got reserved every week for folks coming to have conversations, have business meetings, have their first blind data, to have a job interview or simply to enjoy our amazing food, coffee and wine.  The local police had their own spot in the store where Marcos (our main chef) served them their favorite breakfast, right at 7am.  As a result, we realized with joy and pride that we had indeed created a brand-new family, the COFFEESSIONS family, with a place to enjoy together, as family, as community and as neighborhood.   Our hopes were up, our projections were upward, and our expectations were by the end of February that by Fall 2020 we would be able to gain self-sustainability, multiply and grow.  Fast forward to late spring and Summer 2020, and we have been turned upside-down by the COVID19 pandemic.  At COFFEESSIONS, as a new business, we felt the impact of a community concerned about their well-being and an overall economic standstill.  We have been able to stay open, support our workers and be here for the community.  However, despite some help we obtained through the PPP program, the situation has impacted our ability to keep up with operational cost and rent, limiting our ability to grow as projected and fall behind with bills.  We do have some good plans should we survive.  We will explore the possibility of having drive-through service, outdoor tents with heaters for winter, and launching our roasted coffee blend.  We are also waiting for the National Science Foundation who has promised to support us in bringing into fruition nutritional coffee technology.  It is expected that 75% of independent businesses will not survive.  I am personally doing everything in my power to save COFFEESSIONS, to keep it open with a safe workforce and continue to be here for the community, but funds are short, and just this week we got word from the landlord asking the handover of the premise. I think we could survive if we could build a financial bridge between now and the end of the year when some of the projects above would materialize.  I’m really humbled to ask for help, but I believe COFFEESSIONS is more than just a local coffee shop, and it’s worthy of any effort to save.  The use of any fund raised will go to catch up with rent, to enable the drive-through system, establish the winter tents with heaters and launch COFFEESSIONS Roasted Blend.Thanks in advance from all of us and see you soon!!"
Business,The Black Hives Matter Project,"Nevada City, CA",45378.0,40000.0,149,663,3.3K,"Introduction: Beekeeping for me is the answer to my life’s calling — to work in harmony with the rhythms of nature while supporting the physical and spiritual wellbeing of my family and communities. The Black Hives Matter Project was born out of an opportunity to purchase the apiary (bee farm) where I work in Nevada City, California — bringing a loved and long-standing honey business under Black ownership in the least diverse county in California, while providing food, medicine, employment and educational opportunities to my community. It would be a dream come true for my family to step into this role — but it’s not just about us.  The history of African Americans and beekeeping is long and deep, and has been one of the victims of the systematic erasure of the contributions of Black farmers from the records of history. I believe that there is immense power in the reconnection of this African diasporic insect and the African diasporic peoples in the Americas. I’m grateful for the opportunity to reclaim this relationship and share it with all of my communities. Historical Context: It is unsettling that a google search of the history of African American beekeepers turns up almost nothing. History tells us that the ""European"" Honey Bee was brought to this continent by way of the Virginian colony in 1622, shortly after the first enslaved African peoples arrived in Virginia in 1619. The enslaved peoples of Africa were the force behind most of the agriculture in what would become America. The conclusion that enslaved Africans were beekeepers in North America is self evident.The relationship of African Americans and bees is deeper still. The domestic honeybee widespread across the globe, including America is known as the European Honeybee although science confirms that this bee originated on the African continent. In fact the earliest depictions of domesticated bees are hieroglyphs in ancient Egypt. And the traditions are still alive — ancestral beekeeping is an ancient practice carried out by tribes in Kenya such as the Kamba, Maasai, Samburu, and Mbeere. As Black people of the African diaspora, we deserve our relationship as stewards of this diasporic pollinator to be recognized historically, and to be integral participants in the field of beekeeping today. It bears repeating that there is immense power in the reconnection of this African diasporic insect, and the African diasporic peoples in the Americas. About our bees: Our bees are kept across multiple counties in the Sierra, providing pollination for local farms and creating a sustainable circuit that keeps small agriculture businesses alive. The recent waves of colony collapse (it is considered average for beekeepers to lose 40% of their hives each year) are primarily due to pesticides and parasitic mites. As stewards of these tiny and majestic creatures, we are committed to maintaining environmentally sustainable healthy hive practices. As a testament to the care and skill my team and I will bring to this project, my hives generally suffer less than 25% losses — significantly lower than the national average. Why now + What we need: 

STRETCH GOAL: You all crushed through the first goal in less than 48 hours. But we were telling the truth about that being the bare minimum needed and we're going to keep going! Our new goal is $40,000 — which will help us be more prepared for the challenges of starting a new business, and start to build our resources for acquiring a new location for the business — one that we hope will be large enough to contain a variety of farming and healing projects! We are overwhelmed by the amount of community support we're finding in the project and are going to keep it going as long as you will. Thank you, the bees thank you, please keep helping make this dream come true. 

---We have already secured over $130,000 for this project — $100,000 from a business loan and $30,000 of our life savings. We need $150,000 to move through a contract to purchase the apiary. That’s why we’re asking you to help us raise $20,000 — the bare minimum we need to move this deal through. Anything raised over this minimum will go towards expediting our process towards achieving our goal of setting up educational programming about beekeeping and the history of Black beekeeping in the United States. We were offering gifts for donations but we have been informed this is against GoFundMe policy so we can no longer offer that. if you previously donated please reach out to us privately.Please donate, like, and share widely.

And it is our hope that we can continue living out our dream during this unprecedented time and it doesn’t dry up and become another dream deferred.The dream began when I was looking for a job and was introduced to Bob Romanow, owner of Frugal Furniture in Roxbury. We met at the furniture store and I saw there was a section with books—all primarily by authors of color. I had never seen so many books by people of color in one place, and it just looked beautiful. It made me very proud. And as an avid reader I knew how important it is for all people to see themselves in the literature they read. Bob saw how smitten I was and he asked me to help him build a book business.It became my mission to assist Mr. Romanow, and when he saw how dedicated I was, he offered to sell me the bookstore portion of his business. I shared the offer with Clarrissa and she was as excited as I was for the opportunity, so I accepted it. We decided to keep Frugal in the name simply because it was already known in the community, and why fix something that was not broken. And that’s how Clarrissa and I became owners of the Frugal Bookstore.Our family, friends and supporters  have watched us thrive over the years, and they’ve seen that it is very possible to own a business in the community you grow up in. And not just any business—one that offers value, a business where you can come in and you light up and feel proud that it is in Roxbury, our community.We are the only bookstore in Roxbury, and the only black-owned bookstore in the city of Boston, we are one of a kind. It was built with a passion and infused with a desire to “Change Minds One Book at a Time.” It is a community space that has inspired many readers, and has hosted a number of events which include book signings with local authors and many from out of state. It is home to The Family Affair Book Club and The Cool Girlz Book Club.In 2018, we received an invitation to partner with the Boston Book Festival to help bring the biggest literary festival in New England to our neighborhood, Roxbury. It was thrilling to see our community come out and support the effort. And in 2019 we were bestowed the honor of Business of the Year by Dudley Main Streets and the City of Boston. We were having such a great time and then all of a sudden the pandemic hit and put us in a position where we are struggling to maintain the business needed to keep us going until society opens back up and the community is allowed to come back in.

The Raptor bi-weekly updates are thoroughly entertaining to watch, and we have probably learnt a thing of two along the way.   Most of us following this project are invested in some form or another.  It has been Peter's vision & ambition from the start to keep costs down for the benefit of the General Aviation community, future owners and enthusiasts.  In business terms, he has done a lot of the heavy lifting, to do his best to minimise costs whilst inspiring innovation.  We trust, in the long term, this will ultimately benefit both owners and the wider community should the project remain in his capable hands at this time.  Your donation will go a long way to achieving that, without the commercial stresses of potential 3rd party investment at this late stage in the prototype production. They say ""when the going gets tuff, the tuff get going"".  Let's help Peter get this aircraft in the air and show some appreciation and support to assist Peter and Raptor LLC through the final stages of the prototype.  Donate a little or a lot - your donation will go along way to helping with the associated costs that will prevail over the coming weeks/months given the final mods required before flight as well as the Test Pilot costs etc. Contribute to keeping the dream alive!  Donate now, and let’s help to get this aircraft airborne! More info - click to view:Raptor's YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/channel/UCyEqCPjfEG1Cwt8-YEAOxbg Raptor's Facebook Page: www.facebook.com/raptoraircraft Raptor's Instagram Page: www.instagram.com/raptor_aircraft/?hl=en Raptor Website: www.raptor-aircraft.comNB: All Donations go directly to Peter Muller via GoFundMe."
Community,The Tanqueray Trust,"New York, NY",2697200.0,1000000.0,67,127.1K,30.4K,"Early this year, I was walking home from the gym on a particularly cold day. I was still dressed in my running clothes. And as I neared my home, I passed by a 76-year old woman dressed in a floor length faux mink coat. She was gripping tightly to a railing. ‘You look great,’ I told her.  Then she pointed at my own clothes— ‘Let me ask you a question,’ she said. ‘Why is it always white boys who wear shorts in the winter?’And thus began my friendship with Stephanie. One of Stephanie's more endearing  traits is that she will launch into a wild story within seconds of meeting a person-- often before customary greetings are exchanged. And that's exactly what she did. She began telling me stories from the 1970's, when she worked as a burlesque dancer named Tanqueray. Her memory for detail was amazing, and she had a singular way of describing things. Stephanie will say the wildest things without a hint of self-consciousness. It really has a way of drawing you in. And after she'd been going for about five minutes, I interrupted for long enough to ask if I could run to my house and get my camera.  The resulting interview went quite viral, as many of you will remember. And Stephanie had a lot of fun with it.  People were stopping her on the street all day long. And Stephanie loves an audience-- even if it’s just an audience of one. So anyone who stopped her for a selfie would leave ten minutes later with an earful of stories. And what stories they were.  Nobody has lived a life like Stephanie’s. The two of us agreed to meet regularly at a nearby diner, so I could get her whole story down on paper. We did about twenty interviews together. Our initial plan was to create a podcast. But after we'd gone quite a distance down that path, circumstances suddenly changed. Stephanie has been in pain for as long as I've known her. When we first met she was walking with a cane. And every time we walked to the diner, she'd grip tightly to my arm. Even then-- it would take us fifteen minutes to travel half a block. She’d wince in pain whenever she was jostled or bumped. Occasionally she’d scream out. It was clear that something was seriously wrong with her leg. She attributed the injury to a bad fall that she'd suffered a few months earlier, but she seemed confident that she was on the mend. When the pandemic started, Stephanie and I continued our conversations over the phone. She would call me several times a day. And whenever I didn't answer, she'd always leave a voicemail—usually telling me some story she’d just remembered. Last month I grew concerned when a few days passed without hearing from her. I called a neighbor to check up on her, and he heard Stephanie's voice coming from the back bedroom. She'd taken a bad fall and had been on the floor for 72 hours without food or water. The EMTs broke down her door and took her to the hospital. Ever since the fall, Stephanie has been unable to stand or walk. She is in a lot of pain. She's always been  a private person in many ways, but the current crisis has necessitated a candor about her situation. We’ve hired a team of professionals to make her apartment clean and comfortable. We’ve gotten her a 24-hour home health aide. She now has a physical therapist coming to the apartment multiple times a week.  And we're working on handling the back rent and eviction notices. Her health is not improving as quickly as we'd like, but Stephanie remains absolutely convinced that she is on the mend. Unfortunately her unorthodox lifestyle hasn't qualified her for social security. And she doesn’t currently have insurance. (Though we're trying to get her signed up for Medicare.) Her care is extremely expensive. So far I’ve been using funds from the HONY Patreon, but it’s not sustainable long term.   Stephanie and I have decided to scrap our idea of making a podcast. And I’ve spent the last few weeks retooling the story for publication on Humans of New York. Our plan is to raise funds for Stephanie’s care alongside the telling of her story. The ultimate goal is for Stephanie to live the rest of her life on her own terms. Maybe that means an assisted living facility. Maybe that means remaining in her apartment with the assistance of a home health aide. I’m not sure. But I want to provide her with enough resources so that it’s her decision, and not a decision forced upon her. But I’m not viewing this as charity. Stephanie brings a priceless resource to the table—her story. We're just going to tell that story using a new model.  Instead of selling advertising, or selling it to a publisher, we’re asking for voluntary contributions from anyone who’s gotten value from Stephanie’s narrative. If the story of her life has made you laugh, or cry, or think—please consider compensating the person who lived it. Because right now her story is the one thing she has to offer.We are being very thoughtful with the money. Stephanie knows that there are risks involved with publicly raising funds for a person in her vulnerable situation. So with her blessing, we will be placing the money in a trust to ensure that it provides sustainable, long term care. The trust will cover her living expenses and health care needs moving forward. (Which will admittedly be quite extensive.) And at Stephanie’s request, any money remaining at the end of her life will be donated to The Association To Benefit Children —a highly respected New York charity dedicated to helping the city’s most vulnerable children.Please consider joining us as we seek to transform Stephanie’s life.----------------------------------------------------------Humans of New York is audience supported.If you would like to support Humans of New York, you can do so by joining the Patreon.

Please click the box labelled 'Don't display my name publicly on the campaign' to prevent anyone from scraping and misusing your information.The General Defense Committe Local 1 in Portland, Oregon, has established a fundraiser to cover bail and other legal expenses for protesters arrested in Portland, Oregon in connection to protests against George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police, along with general police brutality. If you get arrested or the police visit or call you because of the protests, please contact the GDC at [email redacted] or 503-442-0866. We will support you through the legal process. Don't talk to the police, especially without legal representation or support. Don’t share pictures of protestors with identifying information (including visible faces).The Portland General Defense Committee (https://pdxgdc.com/) has provided ongoing legal support to workers and protesters in Oregon since 2017, relying on over a century of national experience. The GDC works in connection with the National Lawyers Guild and other Portland-based organizations.The legal process can take a tremendous amount of time. Most cases take 6 months to a year to be resolved and some cases can take up to two years.   For this reason,  disbursements and reporting will be ongoing possibly up to two years from now depending on people’s charges and cases. We will be continually updating information regarding these expenditures as money is used to bail people out and support peoples’ legal cases. These reports will be available through GoFundMe updates and our website. Because we have access to limited funds, our first focus is freeing vulnerable protestors (including those at high risk of contracting COVID-19 while incarcerated, members of marginalized communities (especially BIPOC protestors), and those without stable housing. Initially, the GDC set a fundraising goal of $5,000. As the number of reported arrests rise and the severity of the charges have increased, we have raised that goal to meet increased demand. Funds raised through the GDC will be distributed directly to protestors facing legal action as any financial needs come up. The funds will be used to pay for bail, legal fees and fines, lawyers, discovery, investigations, personal material support and any other financial needs that arise during the legal process. Funds raised in excess of local needs will be directed to Black-led organizations working in Portland and bail funds supporting protestors in other US cities. The legal process for these protestors is only starting: we’re seeing arraignment dates set months out. Arraignment typically occurs in a matter of days and this extended schedule will increase the expense, stress, and other harm protestors face. In addition to financial support, we’ll be asking for community members to attend hearings and participate in the defense of our comrades. Subscribe on Twitter (https://twitter.com/pdxgdc) or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/pdxiwwgdc/) to receive updates as the legal process proceeds.Amelia Cates and Thursday Bram are members of the Local Secretary Treasurer working group of the GDC.

Our EIN is 85-1376745.]Introducing House of Tulip .House of Tulip is a Community Land Trust launching in the summer of 2020 to create housing solutions for trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) people in Louisiana.1 in 3 trans people in Louisiana report experiencing homelessness at some point in their life.* With your help, we will break that cycle for good in the New Orleans area.Who We Are:Our Founders Circle is a multicultural and multigenerational leadership body of 11 individuals in the New Orleans area. We are majority-Black and majority-women, and a majority of us have our family roots in Louisiana for several generations. Together, we have over 100 years of experience as community organizers and activists serving the transgender community in Louisiana. We are Milan Nicole Sherry, Mariah Moore, Jai Celestial, Sultana Isham, Camilla Marchena, Dylan Waguespack, Ben Collongues, Wendi Cooper, Toni Jones, Zahair Martinez, and Spirit McIntyre. Our Short-Term Vision:We’re raising funds to buy and restore a 6-unit property on N. Claiborne Ave, currently unoccupied and blighted. This will be our pilot campus, and it will house up to 9 TGNC people. If for any reason, we're unable to purchase this property (if it's sold or taken off the market before we raise the funds we need), the funds raised by this campaign will still go directly toward providing housing to TGNC people in New Orleans, in line with the long-term vision below. Our Long-Term Vision: Housing Solutions.According to the US Trans Survey, 1 in 3 trans people in Louisiana reports experiencing homelessness at some point in their lives. House of Tulip will provide zero-barrier housing to trans and gender-nonconforming people in need of a safe place to stay while growing the supply of affordable housing in New Orleans. Citywide Benefits.By operating as a Community Land Trust, the entire city of New Orleans (as well as anywhere we expand beyond our pilot campus) will benefit from the increase in affordable housing supply and safeguards against exclusionary development and gentrification. Paths to Home-Ownership.House of Tulip isn’t an emergency shelter or a transitional living house. It’s a long-term investment in housing solutions. As members of our community gain stability through housing, they’ll have a path to homeownership. Meanwhile, House of Tulip will continue to own the land, ensuring our housing stays affordable forever.Self-Sustaining.While initially our funding will be entirely donation-based, our model will grow to include sustainable sources of income so that we can invest strategically.We have $50,000 in seed funding--12.5 percent of the way to our goal--but we need your investment to get to $400,000 by August 31, 2020.If you'd prefer to write a check, please make it out to ""House of Tulip"" and mail it to our treasurer:Dylan Waguespack1203 Trinidad Ave NEWashington, DC 20002If you would like to give monthly, you can become a sustaining donor on our website at https://houseoftulip.org/make-a-donation. Becoming a sustaining donor helps us budget wisely knowing how much money will be coming in.

Memphis faces a serious lack of emergency housing: In 2016, there were only 71 beds available in emergency shelters across the metro area—and none of them were designated as trans-specific. Many of them actively discriminate against transgender people.Our Executive Director, Kayla Gore, and board member Ellyahnna C. Wattshall created My Sistah’s House in response to a crisis they were witnessing among their own community members. Executive Director, Kayla Gore, converted a six-bedroom house she owns, into an emergency housing facility with eight beds available for TLGBQ people in need of shelter. My Sistah’s House primarily serves TGNC people of color, many of whom have recently been released from incarceration, are experiencing intimate partner violence, and/or are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.Expanding on our emergency housing program, our volunteer staff set up a bail fund for incarcerated trans women in the area, and began offering our clients advocacy, legal and multi-level resource assistance to help them secure permanent housing and stable income. Within the last year alone, with limited resources and an all-volunteer staff, My Sistah’s House has provided emergency housing to 35 TLGBQ individuals, successfully transitioning them into permanent housing. We have also provided multipronged resource assistants to100 individuals, allowing some of our communities most vulnerable to become more self-sufficient and secure.My Sistah’s House works in partnership with our fiscal sponsor, The Knights and Orchids Society My Sistah's House is asking during such a Fragile time in our Country, where Black Trans Communities are continuing to Stand in Solidarity with ALL Black BODIES and our Country.

His fear is that once he graduates, they will lose their home and have nowhere to go. There is $125,000 left on the mortgage. As a family friend, I have organized this fundraiser for Brandon and his brothers because this financial burden seems like a huge mountain for an 18 year old to move. But if everyone can find it in their heart to donate what they can, maybe we can put a dent in that number or even erase it. As a community, we've all experienced so much sadness and heartbreak since the declaration of the pandemic. Let's try to do something positive, uplifting and life-changing that could shift the course of these boys' lives forever.I have set the fundraising goat at $150,000. Funds will be distributed to the bank to pay off the $125,000 mortgage. Proof of payments will be posted on this page. The additional $25,000 will help ease the burden of living expenses, property taxes, as well as covering costs associated with Brandon's education at Middlesex County Community College where he plans to pursue a career in Law Enforcement.Think of the joy it would provide for them if we could help pay off that mortgage and provide a forever home for them.

Community,Protect Farm Field Workers,"San Jose, CA",210772.0,200000.0,96,5K,4.1K,"
It’s time we acknowledge our essential workers on the field and in the farms. As they supply our food every day and go unnoticed in the dark smoke. The conditions these workers are in are unacceptable considering the pandemic the heat and now the fire smoke. But regardless of the conditions they show up every day for us. So it’s time to show up for them. When we went out there to ask them what we could help with their first response was they needed basic school supplies for their children. We were shook by this response, how is it that our essential workers don’t have enough money for basic educational supplies as we enter a school year of distance learning. These farm workers are more concerned about the school year coming up as they can’t be there for there children because they are at work feeding the nation. But for people that care so much about others, who is going to care about them? WE ARE. If this system doesn’t care, WE DO.  And if we have to stand as a community to make a difference where it counts, WE WILL. You see even if these farm workers prefer the funds go to their childrens education, we still need these workers to be protected. We need to protect our farm field workers. We have gotten news that some of these employers are not supplying their workers with protective working equipment as they continue working in this hazardous smoke from the nearby fires. More than ever we need to stand up for those serving our community. Migrant workers should receive higher wages and better working conditions as they are essential. This fundraiser was created by Flor Martinez, animmigrant rights activists who herself worked asa farm worker before she qualified for DACA. 

Flor has multiple contacts in the agricultural community and is able to direct these funds directly to farm supervisors by transportation vehicles to the farm sites and have distribution by volunteers. 

These funds along with the additional Venmo funds will divided in half between the farm workers protection and the farm workers children school supplies.  

Funds will be withdrawn into the non-profit The Celebration Foundation, where all masks and school supplies are bought electronically with clear transaction receipts posted on the website coming soon. 

The people benefiting from this fundraiser is farmworkers and farm workers children, Flor is able to distribute supplies directly to her wide set of contacts who trust her enough to show up to these farms and fields.

Uncle Hugo's is one of the shining landmarks of science fiction & fantasy literature. It is part bookstore and part archival museum for written science fiction and fantasy books. It is located with its fellow Uncle (Uncle Edgar devoted to mystery) all under one roof in Minneapolis.

Its owner Don Blyly started it in 1974 and has become renown for its selection of rare and hard to find books in pop culture. 



New books help to keep the store running and their stock might be the most comprehensive found anywhere, including a wide selection of used books. Whilemany of the used books are purchased by budget conscious readers, the store’s used books are also a Mecca for rare and out-of-print editions sought by collectors. Curating and maintaining such a wide variety is no easy feat, but Blyly has a knowledgeable staff that he respects as professionals.Last night during the latest unrest and protests that have gripped Minneapolis,Uncle Hugo's was burned down. 

Don Blyly has spent his life building Uncle Hugo's into a treasure for readers, creators, and the community. It is our understanding that the building and most of the stock is a complete loss.

As members of the community I am asking for anyone that can to help in what ever way they can, money for a new location, donations of books, and hard to find items, you name it,

 

Let us rebuild our monument to our passion both for a man that has given so much to the community over the years and our community."

We (the KCPD) advised he's well cared for, but if she wanted to donate for restaurant or gas station gift cards for his family so they can eat at and travel to/from the hospital, we were accepting those at East Patrol Division. She went on to say she lives in the urban core of Kansas City, and her daughter was murdered in 2012. She said the detectives who worked her daughter's case were like her therapists, fathers, and lifelines all in one.She said she lost her job a month ago and has been struggling to pay her bills. She went to the grocery store last week and found a $1 bill in the parking lot. She used that to buy a lottery ticket, with which she won $100. Her 12-year-old daughter was with her and said, ""Mom, we should give that to the police officer who got shot."" She agreed immediately. With her current financial hardship, we urged her to keep the money. She refused, saying the officer's family needed it, and police needed to know they were supported.We at KCPD shared this wonderful act of humanity on our social media. Then hundreds of people said they wanted to help her out. However, the woman had called from an unlisted number and didn't leave a name. It took a while, but we were able to track her down. Her name is Shetara Sims. She is on the left of this photo (along with KCPD social worker Brooke and Officer Earle). She's a struggling single mom. Even when we found her again, she asked, ""Don't the officer and his family need it more?"" Shetara's act of kindness has touched Kansas City, and they wanted to give back. This is your chance to do so!"

Community,Support for the Dohi Family (Noriko & Tora),"Hanover, NH",175282.0,200000.0,54,348,162,"It is with our deepest sorrow that we inform the passing of Dr. Takehiko Dohi, a transplant surgeon.  On September 25th, 2020, Takehiko was taken due to sudden death at the age of 57, leaving his wife Noriko and his son Tora without a chance to say their goodbyes. As the Coronavirus pandemic continues to persist, relatives from Japan cannot come to the U.S. to mourn, which has left Noriko and Tora to grieve by themselves without the comfort of family.  With Takehiko being the sole income source, the Dohi family is now facing financial hardship.  We are calling for help so that Noriko and Tora can manage the many expenses they are facing, including a mortgage and college tuition as well as smaller expenses like utilities and food. With the loss of Takehiko’s job their health insurance costs will increase substantially.  After having worked at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center in Massachusetts for four years, Takehiko took a position at the Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and moved to Pennsylvania in 2017.  He lived alone for three years while his wife and son remained in Lexington, Massachusetts for his son to finish high school, only being able to see them occasionally.  He and his wife had finally reunited just a month ago and settled in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Tora entered New York University this fall to pursue a career in medicine, following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps.  Takehiko was a bright, hardworking, and friendly person.  He was a kind and loving husband to Noriko, as well as an amazing father to their son Tora.  Takehiko often talked happily about his plans to remodel the basement of their new house.  Originally from Kyoto, Japan, Takehiko graduated from Osaka Medical School in 1989 and finished his residency at the Toranomon Hospital in Japan.  Takehiko moved to the US in 2001 to start his career as a physician and researcher. He had worked at Yale University, University of Massachusetts Medical School, and the Wistar Institute at Penn and completed transplant surgery fellowship at the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Florida. We would greatly appreciate it if you would consider making a donation in any amount to support Noriko and Tora.   Thank you very much for your support. This fundraiser was organized by the Japanese community, affiliates of Japanese Language School of Greater Boston, and friends in Lexington, Massachusetts on behalf of Noriko and Tora Dohi."

These individuals are not receiving the critical social and mental health services they so desperately require. This lack of planning is a disservice to these individuals and the community. We have repeatedly reached out to our local officials for help, and have either received no response or condescending platitudes. Oftentimes, they have made personal attacks on our character.  Our voices have been ignored. Now is the time for action.  That’s why neighbors and friends have come together to form the West Side Community Organization.  We are an unpaid, volunteer, non-partisan grassroots organization who met virtually through the recently formed Facebook group, Upper West Siders for Safer Streets , which has grown to a community of nearly 10,000 concerned members.  We are committed to preserving the qualities that make the Upper West Side a great place to live, work, raise a family and enjoy retirement.  We refuse to accept that nothing can be done to solve these issues.  We must protect our children, while at the same time demand that the city provide real services to these struggling individuals.  The current situation is not only unacceptable, it is inhumane. The West Side Community Organization is a 501(c)4 not-for-profit social welfare organization. Donations are not tax-deductible. Your donation will help support our efforts to make our neighborhood safe again and restore our quality of life.  100% of all donations will go toward the retaining of professionals in the fields of communications, government relations and law.  Please learn more about our organization at www.westsideco.org .   Additional information will be coming soon on how to become more involved.* Please note that GoFundMe has an optional fee when you donate.

While this was appropriate in the early years, we now have thousands of program participants attending courses each year in a makeshift campground scenario with an outdoor kitchen, porta potties, canvas tents, and bucket showers. The drinking water well, septic system, and family home are groaning under the impact of this excessive use. Our County Health Department recently notified us that we are no longer operating as a residential site and need to comply with commercial facility guidelines. We need to comply or cease operations. In order to keep offering our farmer training and food sovereignty programming, Soul Fire Farm is building a Program Center, Guest Lodge, Classroom , and Commercial Drinking Water and Wastewater Systems. All buildings will be energy efficient, accessible, fire-safe, environmentally sustainable, and bring us up to code.  Participants in Soul Fire Farm’s Builders Immersions will have the opportunity to learn hands-on building skills during the construction, including basic carpentry, straw bale panel construction, and natural plasters. Once the buildings are finished, we will no longer be confined to the short tent camping season for our overnight programs and will be able to offer spring and fall courses. This will help with our multi-year waiting list by more than doubling the number of people who can attend farmer training. We invite you to join us in Fortifying Our Foundation at Soul Fire Farm! These campus improvements are quite literally essential for the continued food sovereignty work of the organization. It's about investment in the long term future of the farm and our community. ***Soul Fire Farm is an Afro-Indigenous centered training farm committed to ending racism and seeding sovereignty in the food system. Our food sovereignty programs reach over 10,000 people each year, including farmer training for Black and Brown growers, reparations and land return initiatives for northeast farmers, food justice workshops for urban youth, home gardens for city-dwellers living under food apartheid, doorstep harvest delivery for food insecure households, and systems and policy education for public decision-makers."

Community,Legal Fees & Support Fund to Divorce Ramsey Orta,"Las Vegas, NV",130555.0,50000.0,169,4.3K,13.6K,"I, the wife of Ramsey Orta, am a survivor of domestic violence by Ramsey Orta during the Black Lives Matter movement. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jessica (Hollie) Orta, but I am known by Bella Eiko for live streaming the Occupy Oakland and Ferguson movements. Over the last few years I have spoken out about my relationship, and marriage, to Ramsey prior to his incarceration. Ramsey physically, mentally, emotionally abused and financially extorted my son and I as I tried to position myself to organize support for him during his incarceration. After I drove to Las Vegas to avoid any further attacks from him, he used the money given to him by the movement to chase me down to Las Vegas and terrorize myself, my son and my then 82 year old Great Aunt. He often threatened me with gang violence and gave my address to people who wanted to harm me as punishment for not staying to endure more of his abuses while supporting him as he negotiated a lesser prison sentence. In one of our altercations Ramsey physically attacked me by choking me and kidnapping my son for ransom money. You can imagine my shock because of him filming Eric Garner being murdered in the same way. The night before that attack, Ramsey verbally harassed me for not being able to hold in my urination after driving around for over half an hour looking for parking and then walking blocks trying to reach the apartment on Baruch in record breaking cold. These are only a few of the situations I have dealt with during our marriage. I am asking that the movement that has been supporting Ramsey Orta to hold him, and those who knowingly shielded him from any repercussions for his actions, accountable for his domestic actions towards Black Women. I would also like to be able to go through a divorce process without him abruptly being able to stop it. In November of 2019, he backed away from the divorce proceedings, having his attorney tell me that he would be in touch, after I responded that I would want his assistance for long term therapy for my son and I after being exposed to his violence. Help in this area is greatly appreciated as it is more expensive than I can afford as a single mother. I also would like the movements, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Oakland, Hands Up Don't Shoot & I Can't Breathe, to take action in keeping my son and I safe. I have had to move away from the city far from my friends and family because I feel I am in danger if I were ever to return, especially with him now having access to his welcome home fund, coupled with the blind support of many Black Lives Matter supporters. I have been an organizer and given my life to this movement as a Black Woman, and this movement has only stood against me in support of Ramsey Orta. I am asking that this movement consider how it will move forward if it continues to silence Black Women  and overlook the bad action of their heroes. The plausible alternatives for police in handling these kinds of situations moving forward are conversations that I’ve been trying to have for years.I am not asking for police involvement. If I wanted to handle this with the police, I would have pressed charges on Ramsey but I am adamantly against the continuation of the prison industrial complex. I strongly believe in police abolition but we cannot continue to build a movement in which black women and black children continue to be targets of misogyny in their households. You cannot continue to praise someone for a single action, when they've attacked and perpetrated violence towards the most vulnerable people in your community. In order to talk about police abolition we must also talk about the future we wish to replace it with. We will not be able to accomplish that safe future if we don't hold accountable the actions of individuals that resemble those of the same patriarchal system. With love & All Power to the People, Bella Eiko"

Now the farming season is starting and the window to purchase CSA’s is coming to a close. CSA farm shares are finite, and there are only so many we can buy no matter how much we raise. So what’s next!?Visioning a sustainable, food secure future for our people, we are looking for ways to cultivate food ourselves. A future where Black and brown people in Vermont can come together to live, heal and thrive. Which to us, means purchasing land for farming, gardening and intergenerational healing. A space that is stewarded by Black and brown people, a place of safety, connection, and healing.Our vision is to build healing and nourishing spaces for our people and our children in the here and now but our vision is long-range as we look to the future. A future where food sovereignty is guaranteed to the next generations of Black and brown people in Vermont.We have been looking at Soul Fire Farm and Freedom Farm as a model for what we envision creating here in brattleboro. A place to connect our children and our people back to the land, a place to heal and reclaim our stories and the wisdom our ancestors left for us. A place to build black futures right here in our own community and create safety.Help us realize this dream by donating to our fund.We are in the very beginning stages of a long term vision which will require learning about land trusts and ways for us to secure land for the future.Love us alive, don’t idolize us when we die. Protecting black futures and people means creating spaces for us to THRIVE while we are alive not waiting for us to die.The SUSU Healing Collective is a BIPOC led collective in Brattleboro, VT. We are raising funds to purchase land that will be a safe place for BIPOC in VT and will include educational programming, land access, farming, CSA's and food access, restorative justice, school programs and more (all future visions). Right now our hope is to raise $50,000 towards the cost of land to pay for land. $14,000 of the money raised so far is going to the previous project which was to purchase 22 CSA's for POC's in Brattleboro Vermont. susuheals.com****Our people are dying.Black and brown people are dying.We need healing.We need commUNITY.We need safety.We deserve nourishment.We deserve joy.We deserve connection.We are reaching out to our community for support, we need you now more than ever. We have experienced love and support during this time and questions of how you can help us. This is what we need:We hope to raise $12,000 to fund 20 local Brattleboro POC (people of color) CSA's for this year. These times are traumatizing, on top of a global pandemic our POC communities are being hit the hardest, we are watching our people be lynched and murdered in cold blood. We are dealing with the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual pain of witnessing this and living and operating everyday in a white supremacist culture.On top of all of this trauma we want to make sure that our people have opportunities to experience nourishment, that they have the chance to connect to the earth for healing, that they can have access to healthy , life giving, and nourishing food and that this will be one less thing they have to worry about.Over the next few months we will be launching a  few more gofund me's, the next one will be for funds that can be used  for 20 Brattleboro POC's to take a workshop, class, or healing sessions that they choose that will contribute to their healing and connection, the following gofund me will be to raise money for the SUSU so we can provide free healing sessions and herbs to our people. Will you join us in healing our people starting right here in Brattleboro?With government relief packages and funding one thing that has become more apparent to us is the lack of trust our country has with POC led organizations and people, funding is generally funneled into white led orgs, covering admin budgets and salaries and then very little trickles down and gets to the people who need it. Leaving many of our people under the radar and with lack of access to life giving foods and opportunities for healing (the healing that is culturally relevant and needed for us).We are asking you to trust us.We are asking you to trust POC led organizations and people.We are asking you to trust that we know what we need and that we don't need white orgs. to tell us what we need and what healing looks like to us.We are asking you to direct fund/support POC's in our community and POC led organizations in our community.Thank you so much for your support. This is how we build commUNITY, this is how we build cultures of reciprocity and healing, this is how we build black futures, this is how we care for our people.Every penny, every share on social media, every mention to your friends, every share on IG makes a huge difference.Thank you Brattleboro, we know together we can do this!With love and divine blackness,The SUSU Healing Collectivesusuheals.com"

While we are tired, many of us also hear the calls to action of this moment and want to do what we can to address the injustice experienced by George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many more. As we navigate this time, I encourage everyone to VALUE LIVES FIRST - please prioritize donating to bail out funds, legal defense funds, social justice funds and other organizations continuing the daily fight to end structural racism rooted in white supremacy. A list of priority organizations to donate to is provided below.If you are able to do more, there are other steps we can take to support the long-term economic viability of the black community in our city.  While the majority of black-owned businesses were unharmed during the most recent protests, a few received superficial damages to their store fronts, including broken glass and graffiti. Our black business community is already suffering financially as a result of COVID-19 closures and they run the risk of long-term hardships or permanent closure.  Repair costs can be significant— as a point of reference, it costs about $1,400 to replace a single piece of plate glass and insurance deductibles are often even more expensive for business owners. With this in mind, we know that small amounts will go a long way for our vital small businesses during this time. As always, I believe in the resiliency of the black community here, both in the face of racist tyranny and economic uncertainty, however it is up to us to support our own. Please join me in raising funds to be used as small grants of between $100 - $500 (depending on how much is raised) to help reimburse expenses  incurred by Black-owned businesses to repair damage caused by protests. The plan is for funds to be distributed as shown below starting June 1, 2020.“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.It is our duty to win.We must love each other and support each other.We have nothing to lose but our chains.”Assata ShakurWith Love,Elisse *If you are interested in co-sponsoring this fundraising effort, helping to distribute funds and/or helping with business outreach etc. please let me know.Reimbursable costsGlass repair and replacementGraffiti abatement (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement)Facade and sidewalk cleaning  (ex. cleaning supplies, painting supplies, graffiti coating replacement costs, trash removal)Who is EligibleGround floor black owned businesses in Oakland damaged during the May 28-31st protestsHow the Funds will be DisbursedA Google forms application will be distributed via social media and other organizations in Oakland that support black businesses.

It has left many Louisiana musicians and others who work in the music industry facing a total or near-total loss of income for the foreseeable future.  The Jazz & Heritage Foundation has invested proceeds from Jazz Fest directly into the community with grants to fund projects that support the Foundation's mission. Over the last 10 years, more than $6.1 million dollars have been awarded in Community Partnership Grants.  Through the Jazz & Heritage Relief Fund, the Foundation will continue its support of Louisiana’s music industry professionals during these uncertain times.  Establishing this fund is part of its wider plan to support the local cultural community in the coming months. Executive Director of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation, Don Marshall, said “Performances and concerts  have been  cancelled and musicians are losing opportunities to support themselves and their families.  For generations, the musicians of our community have provided the soul of Louisiana.  The goal is to help our musicians impacted by quarantine, disruptions of income, and other challenges, while ensuring an equitable distribution of funds.” New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Board President, Jeffrey Goldring, added that “The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation invests proceeds from Jazz Fest and additional funds that we raise for year-round programming in education, economic development and cultural enrichment.   Our education programs include the Don “Moose” Jamison Heritage School of Music, the Tom Dent Congo Square Lectures, the Class Got Brass competition for school brass bands, a youth audio workshop program, youth vocal workshops, and more!  Economic Development initiatives include the Community Partnership Grants, the Catapult Fund accelerator program and Sync Up entertainment industry workshops.  Cultural enrichment programs include the Jazz & Heritage Concert Series and annual Foundation Festivals: the Crescent City Blues & BBQ Festival, the Congo Square Rhythms Festival, the Tremé Creole Gumbo Festival and the Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco Festival.  Importantly, these are free programs that the Jazz and Heritage Foundation has developed over many years to ensure that we give back to Louisiana.   The Jazz & Heritage Relief Fund is a natural extension of the work we have been doing for the community since 1979. “ For more about the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation, please visit us online at www.jazzandheritage.org."

We are calling upon YOU to raise funds during this difficult time until it can re-open and thrive. Invest in our community space: to keep the drag queens lip-syncing, bartenders SERVING, the dancers dancing all night, and YOU living your authentic life in a REAL atmosphere. After the SIP Order, the bar’s owner,  William Erkelens, applied for a PPP loan and received only a fraction of the requested funds because the business is just “too small.” Erkelens has been paying rent and utilities out of his own pocket. All money raised will go towards direct business expenses: rent, utilities, and operations. Any funds received beyond our goal will be invested in the long-term sustainability of your favorite community gathering place. Here’s a little Aunt Charlie’s history: the Lounge opened in 1987 near the corner of Turk & Taylor when the Tenderloin neighborhood was bustling with gay nightlife. Aunt Charlie’s is known for Sunday fundraisers and weekly drag and disco parties: Hot Boxxx Girls, Tubesteak Connection, and Angels (formerly High Fantasy and Chasers). In 2014, the block where Aunt Charlie’s is located was renamed to honor Vicki Marlane, a beloved performer and bar regular.

Community,Embrace Loses County Funding over BLM Support,"Ladysmith, WI",100861.0,112500.0,42,2.1K,4.7K,"Barron County Cuts $25K From Domestic Violence Shelter Over Support Of Black Lives MatterSeveral Regional Law Enforcement Agencies End Relationship With Advocacy Organization, Saying It Supports 'Anti-Police' MovementBy Rich Kremer, Wisconsin Public RadioPublished: Wednesday, October 14, 2020, 6:00amThe WPR article by Rich Kremer (https://www.wpr.org/barron-county-cuts-25k-domestic-violence-shelter-over-support-black-lives-matter) can be read below.Barron County has cut $25,000 in support for a domestic violence victims advocacy organization for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and calling for an end to racism and police violence.The Barron County Sheriff's Department and others in the region are also cutting ties, citing the group's support of ""social issues that are negative towards law enforcement."" The community-based outlet Drydenwire.com posted a statement from a chief deputy of the Washburn County Sheriff's Department, saying that they too — along with the Shell Lake Police Department, Spooner Police Department, Minong Police Department and Birchwood Police Department — were ending their affiliation with Embrace based on the statement.On Wednesday, Sept. 30 the advocacy organization Embrace issued a statement saying that in order to ""end intimate partner violence and sexual violence, we must grapple with our country's long history of racism, slavery, genocide and colonization.""The statement continued by stating that racism and white supremacy are ""prevalent in our communities"" and that violence disproportionately affects communities of color, including Black women and indigenous women. It ended by affirming support of the Black Lives Matter movement and calling for allies to ""break the cycle of trauma created by racism and violence.""The next week, members of the Barron County Board of Supervisors executive committee went into closed session to discuss the county's relationship with Embrace. After gaveling back into open session, the board voted to stop funding the organization by cutting $25,000 slated to go to the advocacy group next year. Supervisors also voted to have the county's director of Health and Human Services resign from Embrace's board of directors. County HHS director Stacey Frolik didn't discuss what happened during the closed session, but told WPR the dispute between the county and Embrace started when ""there was some outward facing support for Black Lives Matter."" She said before the Embrace statement went public it was presented to the group's board of directors, of which she was a member at the time. She said she and other board members indicated that the statement shouldn't have been released.""And from a departmental standpoint, I was not feeling comfortable continuing on as a board member of Embrace, just knowing kind of the stance that they were taking with, you know, with law enforcement,"" said Frolik. ""That made me very uncomfortable personally and professionally.""Frolik said Embrace has been serving as the county's domestic violence and sexual assault advocate for just over a year. Before that, she said the county had one employee who focused on those services. As a result, Frolik said the county didn't have the ""depth of services"" that it currently does.She said the $25,000 that would have gone to Embrace is still in the county's budget for domestic abuse services. The county still refers domestic abuse survivors to Embrace, but Frolik said that funding could possibly be used on direct assistance for survivors if the relationship between Embrace and the county deteriorates further.Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald had already resigned from the Embrace board prior to the statement issued at the end of September, in part because of signs posted by Embrace supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which he said advocates for defunding police departments. Fitzgerald said the group's support could alienate some victims of domestic violence or sexual assault, particularly those with ""law enforcement relationships.""""We were some big supporters of Embrace and we felt that they were not supporting law enforcement and taking the side of some of the anti-law enforcement out there,"" said Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald said while the relationship has been cut, his department will still refer victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to Embrace for services. Embrace Executive Director Katie Bement said Barron County's decision to cut the $25,000 in future support caught them by surprise. She said the organization's support of the Black Lives Matter movement is not a criticism of local law enforcement agencies.  ""We really have this understanding that racism, police violence, sexual violence and domestic violence all have the same root causes and they interact and compound on each other, both in society and the survivors we serve,"" said Bement. ""So, we feel we can't remain silent and neutral in the face of violence and oppression, or we're doing harm.""She said none of the survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault they work with have complained about the statement or support of Black lives Matter. Bement said local police and Embrace should be able to disagree without defunding services that survivors of violence depend on. Dave Willingham is the chair of Embrace's board of directors. He said the statement issued at the end of September was reviewed by board members and while some ""expressed more misgivings about some of the language than others,"" no members said it shouldn't be released. Willingham said the idea that Embrace's support of Black Lives Matter is akin to calling for local law enforcement agencies to be defunded isn't accurate. ""And so it seemed ironic to me that somebody would object to the words 'Black Lives Matter' on the basis that it represents defund the police, and then turn around and advocate for defunding Embrace,"" said Willingham. Bement and Willingham said they're hoping to meet with the Barron County Board of Supervisors Executive Committee to explain their statement and advocate for the return of their 2021 funding. Embrace isn't the first victims advocacy organization to support anti-racism efforts and the Black Lives Matter Movement. In July, The Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault and End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin issued a joint letter titled ""Moment of Truth."" It said the coronavirus pandemic, increased police violence and political and economic upheaval produced the ""perfect storm"" that advocacy organizations have to face. ""We have spent decades building our movement’s voice and power,"" said the letter. ""How we use them now will define us in the years ahead. Let our actions show that we did not stand idly by. Let them show that we learned, changed, and will continue to demonstrate that Black Lives Matter is a centering practice for our work.”Embrace's full anti-racism statement can be found here: www.embracewi.org/antiracism-statementOur Mission and Vision:To end violence, inspire hope and provide unwavering support to all people affected by domestic and sexual violence by engaging our community in safety, equality and partnership.Embrace envisions a courageous social change taking place ending all forms of oppression and violence and creating healthy communities where every person has the support to thrive."

This doesn’t include requests that involve getting specific gear such as a larger tent & cooler for families or smaller backpacks for children & babies. Help us break down the financial barriers that camping brings to the table! Donations go towards the cost of the Camp Kits and additional gear requested plus the cost of shipping items out that cannot be dropped off locally. The way we do things is by buying the kits from retailers depending on additional requests like baby carriers and other outdoor gear for little ones) and then either shipping directly from the retailer to the kit requestee, or shipping and delivering the kits to the recipients ourselves depending on what's going in to the kit and where the recipient lives. If you're in our local area, we can take the kit to you as soon as it arrives! If not then shipping is just fine. We can also ship to Canada! If you’re a white person that has enjoyed the privilege of access to the outdoors (hello pnw!), this is one of many ways to give back & donate! Donations can be $$$ and/or info on good (not crowded, peaceful) camping & hiking in the pnw.

Access that is vital for those in need of the freedom, healing, peace, and fun  that comes with it. For folks in the Tacoma area, we can do local kit drop-offs and give a (socially distant~) demo on tent set up and break down for anyone who wants/needs it. For everyone else we can ship the kits to you and I can offer help over ft or ig if you have questions or need a demo. To get a kit, there’s no need to demonstrate or present anything special, just hmu at [email redacted] or littleuzipervert on ig and we’ll make it work.

As printers have done every decade since Gutenberg, I’m here to argue for a more just society.”Funds raised will provide for inkjet and laser printers, an 11” x 17"" scanner, a Vandercook proof press, a platemaker and filtration system, a paper cutter, a print drying rack, the myriad hand tools and inks needed to print, and provide seed money for literally building a new shop for Moving Parts Press.75% of the edition of her most recent book, The Necropolitics of Extraction , burned before it could be sold and distributed to buyers -- those copies would have funded her next project, Justice and Injustices. We would like to be able to fund the materials for that book as well, to get Moving Parts Press  back on its game producing new work.   Visit Moving Parts Press  for all of Felicia's work. More on her masterwork, DOC UNDOC  here.A new article has just come out on KQED, titled After Wildfire a Family of Artists Faces the Cultural Loss of Climate Change .There's also another GoFundMe page started the day of the fire by Felicia's son Will, here .Much of what was lost in the fire is irreplaceable: type and presses handed down from mentors, an archive of source work that went into creating her lifetime of work, original artwork, and of course, her back stock of limited editions. Felicia is forward-thinking, however, and concentrating on what remains to be done, not what was lost.I was a student at UCSC from 1984-87 and Felicia was one of my teachers there who helped and inspired me to become a letterpress printer. As a teacher, a collaborator, a publisher and an artist, she has influenced many people over her career. I hope Felicia’s community of friends and colleagues in the book and art worlds; artists, poets, and writers; and Moving Parts Press collectors will come together to ensure that this life-changing loss doesn’t end her career as a maker and an artist. Goal:EquipmentInkjet printer/ink $250Laser printer/toner $250Scanner $650Vandercook printing press  $12,000Anderson-Vreeland platemaker requested price $5,000Filtration system requested price $5,000Kutrimmer paper cutter $500Drying rack $500Hand tools $500Inks $500Total ~$25,000Budget for next book:Paper $3,000Plates $3,000Binding $12,000Total ~$18,000Toward building a shop for Moving Parts Press:Architect, construction drawings, permits, contractor costs...Total ~$77,000 and then some...Total goal: $120,000"
Community,Revolutionary Library & Cafe in Uganda,"Collegeville, PA",80003.0,100000.0,171,3.7K,277,"We have a big dream & we need you to show up! Last week we celebrated our 2nd Birthday and hit 500K followers on our Instagram!!!If 5% of our Instagram followers each gave $5 we would easily reach our goal!We know that with this platform comes great responsibility. We do not take that lightly. We have spent much of our time educating this growing, international community.  As we are entering our 3rd year as a team and platform, we want to be even more intentional in how we bring these conversations into the Ugandan context for fellow Ugandans. We believe, fundamentally, that there needs to be a radical shift in the education we receive about history, identity, culture and revolutionary movements around the world.  We spent months considering how we could help make this happen in our city of Kampala. We need to raise $100,000 to make this dream a reality! If you've stuck around long enough, you will know that we have always raised big money for others. We've fundraised for legal fees on multiple cases, the launching of a safe shelter for survivors of sex trafficking, solidarity for Black-lead Philly based non-profits doing important work as well as investing in our Ugandan-lead community projects. We want to break down where this $100,000 will be going:1) Complete start up costs to open a libratory library and cafe that will serve multiple purposes. This space will be the first of its kind in Uganda, providing the public access to books they may otherwise not know about or have access to. Books written by Angela Davis, Kwame Nkarumah, Steve Biko, Marcus Garvey, Walter Rodney, Dr. Amos Wilson, Audre Lorde and Franz Fannon. Biographies written about Malcom X, Fred Hampton, Assata Shakur, Patrice Lamumba, Miriam Makeba and Thomas Sankara.Safe, protected spaces are more important than ever. Especially when you are actively working to combat systems of oppression. This will be a space for gathering, educating, organizing and mobilizing for the revolution. The coffee shop / cafe will provide a unique space to enjoy a meal or a cup of coffee while reading something from our library.  This space will provide jobs in our community and, in the long run, will help us generate income to more sustainably fund our work and the work of our partner projects.2) Bringing a lawyer onto the team has been long overdue. We've worked closely with a number of lawyers both in the USA and here in Uganda to defend our work and to secure representation for those who could not access legal support on their own. It has become very clear over the last 2 years that we need a lawyer on the team to help make us stronger and more strategic in the way we fight and protect ourselves in the process.  This lawyer will be paid a retainer monthly and is based here in Kampala. 3) Financially investing in the 6 Ugandan-lead partner projects we work with around the country. We want to help strengthen the important work they are already doing. As we have watched our platform grow, it has remained a top priority for us to see these organizations amplified and invested into. We don't exist to only critique what is being done poorly but to show you examples of how things can be done ethically."

HELP US BUILD A NEW FUTURE FOR BLACK FAMILIES & OUR ALLIES BY BRINGING AMENITIES & UTILITIES TO OUR 96.71 ACRES OF LAND IN TOOMSBORO, GA! When the City of Toomsboro, GA went viral many investors gathered to bid on the 36 parcels for sale in downtown Toomsboro, GA. Our family and friends placed our sights on 96.71 acres of land at the edge of Toomsboro, GA in Unincorporated Wilkinson County Georgia. Our land is just 6 minutes from the Oconee River and Balls Ferry National Park. We were able to purchase our land utilizing cooperative economics. Together 19 relatives and close friends will begin a new development for our elders to retire, our families to enjoy vacation homes, and to create a thriving safe haven for BIPOC all over. We hope to create a space for our family and yours to enjoy family reunions, weddings, healing retreats, marriage conferences, youth survival programs, and apprenticeship programs in farming and construction. When we purchased the land we set out to build it for ourselves and do this for ourselves, and to be a model for other families and friends to create their own communities. Upon purchase of the land, our post went viral and people from all over started commenting, sharing, and asking how could they help us on our mission. So here we are providing an opportunity for all of our extended family and friends who want to be apart of this movement to donate toward bringing amenities and utilities to the land before our big celebratory event on Labor Day Weekend that we are calling the BIG BLACK Campout .We asking for your help to raise $88,000 to help clear the land, hire a team to build roads, pavilions, gazebos, & benches, dig a well for water, create a small camping supply store, connect electricity, and install Wi-FI capabilities to make our Black-owned private land a premier event site for Black families in the age of social distancing. Imagine with us if you will a place full of life and activity where Black families can enjoy the great outdoors, practice sportsmen activities, and connect with nature and the many healing and mental wellness benefits it provides. Will you help us accomplish that dream? We have much more development in the future. We are calling it our 5 Phase Development Plan. Our first step is creating a community not just for our benefit but for yours. So as apart of our fundraiser we have provided a few ways we will honor people that provide NON-Tax Deductible donations (we're not a non-profit organization.) ALL DONATIONS WE RECEIVE BEYOND OUR $88,000 goal will roll over to our second phase of development. In our second phase, our goal is to raise $888,000 for 20 tiny home cabins to be built by Black-Woman owned Mobu Enterprises of Shipping Living based in Macon, GA. Her enterprise will help us set up an apprentice program teaching young people, ex-felons, and veterans how to build shipping container tiny homes on our land.

Community,Fine Dine Front Lines,"Kenmore, WA",80100.0,90000.0,198,332,690,"Fine Dine Front Lines is a non profit organization coming to the immediate aide of suffering restaurants and front line workers. Initially we were focusing on medical staff in cancer related fields well as immediate areas of need within healthcare facilities and began growing from there.Pivoting the ""Give"" mentality by providing new and potentially consistent revenue streams to restaurateurs. Donations generate purchase orders for 100+ meals prepared by kitchens that could use the financial boost. Allows restaurants to produce work, generate revenue and contribute to the community through high quality meals volunteers deliver at no charge to front line workers.How this started:In 2019 my daughter was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma and I with AML Leukemia. Simultaneously. 16 months of chemotherapy had us living in hospitals being nursed back to life by front line workers and their hospitals. We wanted to give back and decided to feed them lunch. In 4 weeks I delivered 1400 meals out of my car with personal finances and the gracious support of a few.  The demand was clear and our focus is direct.  As of today I've relapsed with my Leukemia and am hopefully headed to bone marrow transplant so I'm in hospital most the time literally on the front lines. This motivates me to continue the mission which we can do based on donations and community partnerships.Our website will be functional soon with inclusive fundraising options. We have provided a couple informational pages in the meantime that show the efforts. www.finedinefrontlines.comhttps://www.facebook.com/finedinefrontlines https://www.linkedin.com/company/47612599 https://www.instagram.com/finedinefrontlines/ #SmallBusinessRelief #RugbyCares Thank you Seattle Saracens and Seattle Rugby community for your support!"
Community,Jerk Shack Seattle Land Fund,"Seattle, WA",80172.0,700000.0,175,925,1.3K,"Today, more than ever, we are aware of the opportunity gaps in America. Kids from predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods have lots of dreams they can’t afford, and not enough networked role models to help them figure out how to get over that hump.

We have been fortunate to start our business in downtown Seattle -- the only 100 percent Black-owned restaurant in the neighborhood -- but we know that’s not where the Black and brown community resides. Jerk Shack isn’t leaving downtown, but we are compelled to help our community and bring opportunity to neighborhoods that need it.

Our plan is to start in our city, Seattle, by buying land and building a Jerk Shack in a shipping container, so we’re initiating a Land Fund to help us purchase land in a South Seattle neighborhood like Rainier Beach, Skyway or Renton. 

The vision:
Jerk Shack II would help us achieve the scale we need to serve the community by providing our employees with health insurance, child care assistance, tuition assistance and college scholarships. We’re inspired by Dick’s Drive-In (one of my favorites) that serves its community by providing all of those benefits. Of course, most Dick’s are in predominantly white neighborhoods -- I want to create a source of community like that in Black and brown neighborhoods.

Creating a new, fast casual Jerk Shack with a shipping container concept will be a scalable way to bring the restaurant -- and its associated opportunity -- to any neighborhood. We’d like to test the concept in Seattle, and then recreate it in neighborhoods up and down the West Coast. 

People say the system is broken. Well, it works just fine for those it was built by. I want to create a new system by setting an example of entrepreneurship, community, and social economic stability in the neighborhoods that don’t benefit from the current system. I want to show the younger generation that a person that looks like them and comes from the same place as them can create opportunities that benefit the community as a whole. 

Please join me and donate to this land fund so we can continue to expand as a community together, and build a legacy for the next generation. ~Chef Trey Lamont"

The letter had no return address. It read, “Please Paint Me! :( Eye sore – Your Neighbors. Thanks”.The neighbors were unaware of the circumstances that lead to having to forgo repairs to their home. The house has been in the family for more than 75 years and is the current home to Jimmy and Marilyn Curcuru. Their daughter and mothers caretaker Lynanne also lives in the home. Marilyn is wheelchair bound and has been battling MS for almost 30 years. Jimmy recently recovered from a quadruple bypass. This loving family is well known in Gloucester and most know the hardships they have faced.Having heard of the letter Gloucester residents went into action. The ideas began to come together on how to help this family.In the words of their son Jimmy, “then the greatest city in the world, Gloucester, came to the rescue as they always do for their own.” Jimmy went on to state, “We don’t care who wrote it. We want to enjoy the love and support of this great city we live in. I want to thank everyone for everything you have done and are going to do.”Harvest Moon Builders joined the group, visited the house, and provided an estimate of the work.  They eliminated their management costs and cut their overhead and profit in half.  All equating to thousands of dollars in savings.  Ace Hardware  quickly committed cash and materials to the fund. Hundreds of donors were ready and waiting.In the words of Mayor Sefatia Giambanco Romeo Theken, “I watched this evolve from it’s inception.

For too long, many in our country have had blinders on and it is unacceptable. Inclusivity and diversity have long been hallmarks of Pagliacci. It is forever who we are. Two of our core values; respect and care for employees and do the right thing were formed based on the premise of inclusivity and acceptance.  Yet, we recognize that we must do more.  The work we have been doing on equity and inclusivity needs to continue at Pagliacci in a much bigger way.Since 2018, we have partnered with the organization, Community Passageways, many of you have been involved. The work of Dominique Davis (founder and CEO), and the entire team at CP, is truly inspiring. Their dedicated efforts support the most vulnerable among us. Every day, they fight to save the lives of young adults, mostly African American, by replacing the school-to-prison pipeline with a school-to-life pathway. EVERY DAY. This work is done by the most caring, strong and compassionate group of individuals.  These are just a few of the reasons why we are doubling down on our support for Community Passageways. In addition to the mentoring, the jobs, the pizza and the financial support we have been providing, today, we are writing a check to CP for an additional $10,000 and sponsoring a matching fund. For any contribution to CP, Pagliacci will match up to an additional $10,000. If you, your co-workers or your friends contribute, Pagliacci will match it.  If we come together, we will raise $30,000."

Community,Help Proof Build a New Bakery!,"Mesa, AZ",79807.0,250000.0,68,1.5K,856,"Three years ago, Amanda and I drove to the Gilbert Farmers Market for our weekly bread from a small garage bakery called Proof, only to discover that the owner was moving away. I had a crisis in that moment. Proof was a weekly routine. Having real, quality naturally leavened bread made the way our ancestors made it was an important part of my weekly ritual, and provided grounding after divorce had destabilized my personal life and previous business. I called the former owner first thing on Monday, and drove to meet him at his garage. That day changed our whole life. By Wednesday I started showing up to Jared Allen's garage and learning how to bake for the first time. Within two weeks the bakery was in our home garage, and we were on our own. We have been baking under Arizona Cottage Food Laws, and the bakery has transformed over the past three seasons. In the beginning, we didn't even have a mixer. We were baking as though we were in the Middle Ages.We made this space work. In fact, little by little we began to build a sustainable business. Amanda and I left our other jobs within the first year. By year 2 we had taken Proof from one Farmers Market to three, and desperately needed to buy equipment as we worked literal 20 hours days trying to keep up. In the past two seasons we have also built onto our garage ourselves with the help of my dad. We have been careful to be good neighbors, and good community members. You can drive by our bakery and have no clue that its anything other than a house with a big garage, a pretty common thing in our neighborhood. Unfortunately, one neighbor began phoning in complaints to the City of Mesa about a year ago. He was upset that there were regularly 3-4 cars parked on the street in front of our home, and that our delivery truck was in our driveway. I did my best to make it right. I had to make it right. By this point we were employing a number of people, serving a large amount of customers, and making a future in this line of work. We were also facing large personal issues. Our daughter has a rare genetic disease called Friedreich's Ataxia. Working from home gave us a sense of peace that we could meet her needs, but still do something that we love. During the early days of COVID, Proof became a safe-haven for a number of people that had worked with us part time on Saturdays, and then lost their regular jobs. Our crew members receive full health benefits, and get a chance to bring products of real value to the community. As a business, we are big contributors to a newly created local grain economy. The majority of our flour comes from Hayden Flour Mills, a local stone mill in Queen Creek. The grains they mill are grown here in Arizona. Our business supports many other small businesses, in some cases almost exclusively, like our chocolate partner DNA Chocolate out of Chandler. I poured a parking pad for my employees on my property, and planted 14 large Ficus trees around it. I moved our delivery truck to a nearby storage facility, and now only pull it here once a week to load up for Farmers Markets. Unfortunately, these efforts weren't enough. Our neighbor had discovered an old city ordinance that did not allow for non-resident employees in our zoning district, and focused his attention on that. Back in August, the Vice Mayor and Head of Code Compliance came to our home bakery, sat at our table, ate our bread, and offered support in our inevitable transition. We knew that one day Proof will have to move, but we also knew that financially we simply weren't there yet. In year one Proof wasn't bringing in enough even to support our family. In fact, Amanda sold her first home in Tempe, and used the proceeds to pay for Proof's 2018 season. In year two, we spent all our profits buying proper ovens, mixers, and necessary equipment to actually have a shot at doing this business. We also built our first addition onto the garage. Just this past winter, my dad and I built an RV garage that gave us all the space we need to continue our work comfortably. As we sat at the table with the city leaders, we told them of our daughters situation, and also of the fact that we really needed another 18 months to move on our own. Even though at that meeting they offered verbal support and encouragement, just 4o days later they determined that in fact we couldn't have the time we needed, and that Proof needed to be out of this facility by mid January...just 4 months away. We were devastated. Having worked so hard for three years we started to see our dream slip away. Commercial buildings are expensive. We didn't want to work with a big property developer. We always had an idea to save and buy a place. Then last Sunday I took a drive, and saw a space that didn't have the commercial real estate signs...just a phone number to a man. Miraculously, it is a space that we could see ourselves in. Turning the corner we have decided that we must move forward. Proof has a value in our life, the lives of our crew members, and the community at large. We are taking the plunge, and building a retail bakery in Downtown Mesa. It'll be a place where you can walk in, have a hot beverage and enjoy a pain au chocolat while you overlook an open concept bakery and watch us make sourdough breads and pastry. It'll be a community space geared towards bringing everyone closer to the source of their local food. The space itself is suitable for us to continue serving Farmers Markets around the Valley, and performing the home delivery program that we started during COVID. However, between us and the building is a daunting expense, that we didn't have sufficient time to prepare for. Your help will allow us to keep Proof as special as it has been. It will prevent us from having to make compromises that change Proof's identity, like cheaper ingredients, or less compensation for our crew. It will prevent us from having to take on a second mortgage of debt to outfit a new building, when we already have a perfectly functional one. The funds raised will be put to use to transform the building in Downtown Mesa from its current state, to one that can accommodate the bakery. Architecture will come first, followed by permitting, construction, and finally the expense of moving the bakery. We will complete the project by early 2021, and smoothly transition Proof from cottage to commercial. You help will save our livelihood, and the livelihoods of over a dozen families that rely on the company. Your help will allow this local food economy to have a small light in this catastrophic year. Our business was fortunate to remain stable in recent months, but now we face existential crisis. Words cannot adequately describe the great level of appreciation we will all have for every small offer of help we can receive in this time. We are a community bakery, and in this moment we desperately need our community's help."

A look at how Covid-19 is ravaging these communities:**In data compiled from 35 states and the District of Columbia, the APM Research Lab found that Black Americans are dying at 2.7 times the rate for White Americans.**The health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths. If it were a state, it would rank third in the country for confirmed cases per 100,000 population, behind only New York and New Jersey.**In Sumter County, Alabama only 375 people total have been tested for the virus, 87 of whom tested positive -- an 23% positive test rate that exceeds the rate of infection for other hotspots across the country.We partner with local organizations with proven legacies of serving these groups to assess the needs of their clients, and then leverage our network of donors to collect the funds, supplies and resources required to meet those needs. Every single dollar of your donation goes to supporting our mission of getting protective gear into vulnerable communities. $1 purchases two masks that will be distributed directly to those who need it most.Until We Do It operates under the belief that we can’t wait for someone else to step up and help those who are suffering in the shadows. Solving the most critical problems that we face might seem impossible -- until we do it. www.untilwedoit.orgWe are in the process of applying for our tax exemption status. Once we receive that status all donors will be promptly notified as your donations for this year can and will be marked as tax deductible. Thank you for your patience and continued support!"
Community,Museum Workers Relief Fund,"Chicago, IL",70541.0,100000.0,204,948,1.9K,"It has become clear to us that when our institutions will not stand in solidarity with us, we must stand in solidarity with one another. The Museum Workers Relief Fund operates by the principles of mutual aid: organized by and for museum workers, founded on equity, trust, solidarity, and empowerment of our members, without conditions. We will gather the voices of museum workers offering and asking for aid and, together, we will advocate for a transformation of museum culture that will center dignity, justice, and humanity.We are currently fundraising $50,000 and will distribute $500 each to 100 applicants. Applications for funding will open once we hit our initial fundraising milestone of $10,000. Funding will be available in multiple rounds. Who is eligible for aid? Any museum worker in the U.S. who has been laid off, furloughed, or otherwise severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds are intended for museum workers in the most precarious financial situations, even pre-crisisWho should donate?Museum workers who are still employed, people who love museums, museum board members, museum donors, and anyone looking to support people who bring arts and culture to you daily. We recognize that even for those museum workers who have not been adversely affected by pay cuts and job losses, many are still on tight budgets. Small acts of solidarity add up to a movement! If 5,000 people donated $12 (or 1% of one stimulus check) right now, we would easily meet our initial goal and then some. If you have more than $12 to give, we gratefully welcome your support.

to provide prepared meals for children in the Bronx, NY grades K-12 July 6- August 28 (we are EXTENDING this program through 2020). 

In the Bronx, 31 percent of all children live in food insecure homes; that is, one in four – do not always know where their next meal is coming from. In light of these numbers, Food Bank For New York City called for enactment of the New York City Council’s proposal that free school lunch be provided to all children in the City’s public schools, noting that it would help end the stigma surrounding free school lunch.

With most summer programs canceled due to COVID-19 we want to assure that children have at least one hot meal 3 times a week to fill their bellies and help fill the growing meal gap that exists for struggling families.

100% of your donation will go to food prep and packaging. We are so grateful for your assistance in getting our Full Heart Full Bellies Initiative funded as these children need your help in this ongoing fight!"
Community,Share Your Love for Greater Longfellow,"Minneapolis, MN",67969.0,100000.0,176,416,1.3K,"Portions of the Great Longfellow community are unrecognizable due to looting and fires in South Minneapolis.  The Third Precinct Police Station is located in Greater Longfellow, which meant we were a focal point for both righteous peaceful protest but also the violent destruction. Now burned and vandalized, this area was a hub of community activity with businesses and non-profits that provide essential resources and jobs. We must rebuild and we need your help now. The Longfellow Community Council is the neighborhood organization for the Greater Longfellow community. Racial equity is central to the work we do. We will rebuild a stronger and more just community. Our initial assessment finds that 31 buildings have been completely destroyed, including 3 major grocery stores, and 2 pharmacies. Beyond that at least 49 other businesses sustained significant damage. Many are locally- and minority-owned. We are raising money to implement a three-pronged strategy to aid in rebuilding our community: (1) Food Security, (2) Safety & Security, and (3) Business Restoration (details below.) COVID-19 has already taken an economic toll throughout the US, including Greater Longfellow. Without financial assistance, many of these small businesses are unlikely to recover. The potential loss of these businesses would negatively impact the whole community (Note: many business insurance policies don’t cover damage caused from rioting). Thank you for your compassion and donations.__________________________ 1. Food Security: Part of the funds raised will help our residents who have been impacted by the indefinite loss of food access because of the 3 destroyed grocery stores . Since public transportation is also disrupted, many are struggling to get to necessary supplies. These funds will also be used to support food banks and other meal assistance programs over the long-term.2. Safety & Security: Many in our neighborhood initially felt helpless as they watched their community burn . Residents have now come together working tirelessly to clean up , support each other, and help secure our community. These funds will be directed towards safety needs, including safety lighting for places left dark by destruction, graffiti removal supplies, reflective vests for neighborhood patrols and other community requests.3. Business Restoration: With these funds, we will coordinate short and long-term support for rebuilding businesses. First, we’ll develop a Small Business Assessment & Stabilization Plan to survey the damage and provide a roadmap for businesses to rebuild. Secondly, we’ll create a Small Area Development Plan to help residents take an active role in future development as things are rebuilt."

Thank you for stopping by! My name is Lisa Clinton and I have created this campaign after years of experience with the prison industrial complex. Four decades, to be exact. This is one solution to creating the world that we radicals are scheming and dreaming of. From the decades of abuse at the hands of the carceral state, the quality of Black Womxn’s lives are reduced to the bare minimum. When we are thrown in cages that are not adequate enough for a dog, it not only dehumanizes, it also takes a huge toll on our mental, spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being. Most don’t know how challenging it is to merely survive after a person has a felony on their record. Then add Black on top of that. Then add Womxn. I could add more descriptors, but I’ll stop there. To make matters worse, when we are released from these horrific conditions, we are dropped in the middle of nowhere. Left to end up in homeless shelters, after losing everything we own, and then treated as if we are threats rather than people who need help. Please read further to understand this important work. Support and stand in solidarity if you should feel called to. Thank you for each and every contribution to my BIG work!! Lisa xoxo R.E.S.I.S.T.

We warmly invite you to join the R.E.S.I.S.T. campaign, a vision led by formerly incarcerated Black womxn who include caregivers, sex workers, and mothers to hold, nurture, and heal themselves and our sisters in experience/struggle.This campaign is centered on providing the resources, healing, tools and build a place where these words can thrive and live. In today’s world, there are a lot of social ills. For people who have been impacted by a lack of resources, care, access and community, it is often harder and inaccessible to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. For formerly incarcerated people, who are impacted by the prison industrial complex, harm has and continues to be done. With the pandemic and the uprisings, these realities have come to head and without solutions, there will be more harm and hurt. WE NEED TO HEAL R.E.S.I.S.T. will be a place of pause and breath, nourishment and growth; wholly different than the cold and violent systems of a racist government so many of us have been trapped in.We are raising support so we can do the careful work to ethically find and steward Indigenous land and build a green, sustainable nest to house our return to cooperation and community.  We are done hoping for lucky and love is how we R.E.S.I.S.T.R.E.S.I.S.T. stands for Rebuilding Economic Sustainability In Solidarity Together. This campaign is a solution. It’s a solution that is backed up by research, data, history and now, leaders in movement who want to make something for the long term and sustainable for the future. We want to buy land, support research and operations and bring the team together. To build a place where those who want to farm, teach, skill up and become leaders in the world can without dealing with violence, harm and hurt.Therefore, in order to create solutions, we want to create a place, a center and a home for the people, by the people.

Community,Support Rojai Fentress' Freedom,"Charlottesville, VA",62858.0,70000.0,146,1.7K,2.3K,"Rojai Fentress deserves our help.  In 1996, when Rojai was barely 16 years old, he was wrongfully convicted of murder in Richmond, Virginia and sentenced to 53 years in prison. But Rojai was innocent. Prosecutors had literally no physical evidence linking him to the crime, just two witnesses who testified against Rojai. Nearly a decade later, we uncovered evidence showing that both of these witnesses lied under oath. And yet, Rojai remained in prison for a crime he did not commit.Rojai has always maintained his innocence, turning down plea offer after plea offer - the lowest one for five years - because he refused to confess to a crime he didn't commit.  In 2014, another man confessed to the murder, and he has continued to do so, including under oath. In 2016, the Innocence Project at UVA School of Law began representing Rojai in his fight for justice.On July 1, 2020, Rojai received a conditional pardon from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. Later that afternoon, Rojai walked out of prison the same innocent man who entered it 24 years prior. Rojai has won back the freedom that he never should've lost, and now he needs our help. From life's necessities to larger items, Rojai deserves our help getting back on his feet. This GoFundMe page will help Rojai with everything from clothing and groceries to major living expenses. Having gone away when he was just a 16-year-old boy and now reentering the world a 40-year-old man, Rojai has a lot to catch up on. We can promise you that your contribution will make a major impact for a wonderful man whose radiant positivity is a model example to us all.Legal Details and Other Helpful Information:Who is managing this GoFundMe?This GoFundMe page is managed by law student volunteers working with the Innocence Project at UVA School of Law, which has represented Rojai Fentress since 2016. Where are you based?We are based in Charlottesville, Virginia. What is your relationship to Rojai Fentress?Rojai Fentress has been our client and friend since we took on his case in 2016.

We currently have 88 people committed to donating the full amount of a stimulus check $1,200 to these families (see full list below)!Here’s the problem: Hundreds of thousands of workers were left out of the stimulus package and are in need of emergency funds right now. Essential workers -- caregivers, food service workers, grocery workers, housekeepers, and gig workers  -- and their families are being hit the hardest during COVID-19 as many have received drastic cuts to their monthly income or have lost their job all together. These funds are being disbursed to the highest need individuals who are not getting government assistance right now, including immigrant families and undocumented workers and their kids. Here’s how we’re solving the problem: We just don’t have a roadmap for what we’re currently experiencing—that in and of itself can bring up an immense amount of fear for so many of these families who are in urgent need right now. It’s up to each and every one of us to help the most vulnerable workers and their families ensure they can continue to put food on the table, have the ability to stay home from work when they or a loved one are sick, and weather the economic storm that lies ahead. By donating today, your money will go DIRECTLY to families and workers to navigate the immediate needs they have during this crisis and also build an economic recovery that prepares them for what’s ahead. How can you help? Every little bit is going to make a difference -- your donation will go to emergency funds for these families -- like helping them pay their bills, getting medical supplies, or buying groceries.

This leaves these businesses having to come up with the money to pay for the things that they did not destroy. Some business can barely stay afloat right now with the pandemic going on and thus this expense could potentially shut down the store fronts of these businesses they built from the ground up. To preserve and restore these business, we are asking for any sort of monetary donation you can spare. This fund will go towards replacing broken windows, destruction of personal property in and outside of the establishments, and installation/equipment expenses.  Please share with everyone that you know and get this to exceed it's goal.

Since the shelter-in-place began in mid-March, we have watched helplessly as so many people we have come to know and love descend into struggle as they have had trouble paying rent and bills, and, more importantly, putting food on the table for their families.Many immigrant families and families for whom local and federal programs are not sufficient to meet basic living expenses, such as food, housing, and healthcare in the Bay Area community are in a deep financial crisis right now, with their earning ability reduced or eliminated.  Most do not qualify for the federal stimulus check, nor can they file for unemployment because they are paid in cash as many are employed in landscaping, domestic work, and other professions limited by stay-at-home orders. Food banks are overwhelmed and sometimes turn folks away. At this critical time, we are raising funds to give directly to high-need families in our Bay Area communities (in the form of grocery cards and help with bills), and the organizations that support them. 95% will go to directly to families and the other 5% will go to the Canal Alliance and other nonprofit relief providers. Please consider donating to help these folks who are such a vital part of our community as they could really use a hand to get through this situation.While we wish that we could do more, this is our way of translating our concern into action by providing a tangible way for people to contribute directly to families in need and help put food on the table. If you can spare anything -- perhaps sharing some of your stimulus check if you got one and have the capacity to do so -- for those in deep need at the moment, that would be terrific. Many thanks - Pilar Góngora and Bill Meyer"

Competition,Giving Tuesday: Support Knowbility’s AIR,"Austin, TX",24692.0,40000.0,63,115,119,"Support The Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) For Giving Tuesday, 2020AIR2020 needs your support - will you help  Knowbility produce the 22nd annual Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) competition?  Since 1998, AIR has raised awareness and improved skills in accessible design in the context of a fun, friendly web raising competition. In 2020, we are challenged to keep the program funded - will you help? AIR programs are typically supported by business sponsors and foundation grants In 2019, $65K in sponsor dollars and grant fund covered costs for training, NPO coaching, technology infrastructure, and other program management costs. Since COVID, those funding sources are few and far between for small nonprofits like Knowbility. As we learn to teach, learn, socialize, evangelize, and innovate in an all-new context, we turn to our community for a new way to fund AIR activities this year. Please donate if you can. Evangelizing Accessibility from the GrassrootsThe Internet is not equally accessible to people with disabilities and AIR shows web pros how to change that. In these times when we are all working, learning, shopping, and participating in civic and social activities remotely, accessibility has never been more important. And yet, the most recent State of Accessibility Report (SOAR ) found that more than 80% of public websites are not accessible. Through the years, the Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR) program has served as the Johnny Appleseed of accessibility, spreading seeds of good design with creativity and joy. AIR introduces web professionals and students to digital accessibility with a fun, friendly web raising competition that benefits community organizations, musicians, and artists. Produced at least once a year in cities as far-flung as Austin, Dallas, Houston, Denver, LA, San Francisco, and Boston, we are now learning to stay home and spread the word in a new way. Thousands of people have been introduced to accessibility in the AIR competition or AccessU - and you may be one of them! Many have gone on to work in accessibility for companies like Pearson, Adobe, Microsoft, Visa, Google, Apple, and Facebook. You will find former AIR participants at startups, digital agencies, and schools as well.  AIR alumni work for large accessibility consultancies like Deque and LevelAccess.  AIR is people-centered and focused on the lived experiences of people with disabilities. We use heirloom seeds rather than industrial methods to change the world of digital accessibility.  And it all began as a community collaboration in Austin, Texas.  The need for accessibility has never been greater - please help us continue to spread the word and change design practices to meet the needs of all people. Please give what you canNo gift is too small. We understand that there are competing needs in these hard times. But if you care about equal access to digital information and interactions, please chip in what you can. Together we can continue to improve understanding and commitment to accessibility. Together we can create an inclusive digital world for people of all abilities.  Thank you."

Competition,Mark Mullery Jr’s Golf Campaign,"Myrtle Beach, SC",3830.0,10000.0,132,31,124,"My name is Mark Mullery, Jr. I am a 22yr. old professional golfer with cystic fibrosis who is trying to fulfill my dream of making it on the PGA tour. In order to do this, I need more exposure in events (like the Swing Thought Tour events, tour qualifiers, etc.). Graduating from the Golf Academy of America and being employed as an assistant golf professional at Barefoot Resort in Myrtle Beach has given me the background to get started in my career in the golf industry, but my dream is to play professional golf as a career. Having cystic fibrosis has actually been a blessing to me in a way. It has given me the determination and drive to not let anything stop me from pursuing my dream. Having to fight and work harder than many has made me into the responsible go-getter that I am today. We all face ups and downs, but I have learned to persevere through difficult times and will continue to do so in attempting to go after my vision.Before becoming a professional, I had won four tournaments on the Golf Week Amateur Tour and was nominated as ""Player of the Year"". For the past three years, I have been playing in professional tournaments. Having gained this experience, I believe I am at a point where I can try to make my dream a reality; however, I don't have the funding needed to do so. Due to COVID, I have been out of work for the past 5 months and am unable to return to work because of my health condition and the risks involved. On a positive note, this time off of work has allowed me to devote even more time in practicing and getting ready for my future career.I am hoping to raise enough money to help cover the extremely expensive entry fees for the types of tournaments I need to play in to get recognized. Not only that, but I am also hoping to raise enough money to help cover the cost of travel and hotel accommodations associated with these tournaments. The entry fees for the tournaments I am looking to enter range from $800-$1100 each. If at all possible, would you help to support me  in moving forward with my dream, playing golf as a full-time occupation?  Any donations would be greatly appreciated, and I thank you, in advance, for your generosity"

When Grocery stores were running out of everything, and Mr. K invited students to stop by the studio and pick up farm fresh eggs and toilet paper, free of charge?Remember all those skills you’ve learned through taking Mr. K’s courses in self-defense and survival, that could one day mean the difference between surviving or not surviving? Show some love for Mr. K as he has no doubt shown love for you! Mr. K has been integral in the growth of students from GC Krav Maga, BCKM, COAST, LOST, and other entities that teach civilians how to become informed, prepared, modern day warriors. Mr. K is now preparing to test his skills and take them to the next level. Under contract, he is not allowed to broadcast his endeavors, but he is going to be embarking in one hell of a nomadic journey (don’t worry, he’ll be back when it’s done). Although we’re excited for our friend, we want to note that embarking on this journey also puts Mr. K at financial risk. He will be temporarily stepping away from his many jobs and varied sources of income. This is where our community comes in.With your help, we can keep Mr. K afloat while he’s off being his best self (and hopefully bringing back some new survival tips and tricks for the rest of us). Every dollar helps, if not here in GFM he also takes PayPal, Zelle and Venmo.Thank you so much in your support of my brother. Do what is hard today, do the impossible tomorrow.

My dream is to become a professional motocross/supercross racer. My passion for motocross started when I was only 2 1/2 years old and that was when I got my first dirt bike. It wasn't until I turned 5 that I was introduced to racing and have been racing ever since. My first big achievement was to participate in one of the biggest Motocross events in the State of California in Mammoth, CA. The excitement of the race, where I had the opportunity to race side by side with ridder much more experienced than I was, the adrenaline rushing though my whole body, the thrill of riding, and the emotions behind being part of such a unique sport, made my passion for dirt biking grow even more. The race environment, challenges that I continue to face and the new goals that I set for myself after every race kept me going stronger and stronger, even in the midst of many adversities.My father is my biggest fan and I am forever grateful for all the sacrifices he has made so I can pursue my dream. My father is my wingman, my mechanic, my transportation coordinator, my paramedic when I get hurt, my motivator, the single most important contributor to my career; but behind of all these, he is a good dad. And being the dad that he is, we end up making a deal. I can continue racing if I bring good school grades. I am proud to say that I will be going into 10th grade with a GPA of 4.25In the past 10 years of racing, I have faced many challenges including injury and financial difficulties. Once I had to take almost a year off of racing due to the cost of training fees, maintenance and repairs, not to mention that I have just finished healing up from an ACL reconstruction surgery last year. Presently, I am feeling the best I have ever felt, especially when I am riding on my motocross. Recently I placed 3rd and 4th in the area qualifiers which qualified me for the regional; and at the regionals, I got a 1st and 2nd in two different categories, giving me 2 spots in the biggest amateur race in the United States - The Loretta Lynn’s Ranch, in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee which will take place from August 3rd to the 8th, 2020.My father and I will be driving from California to Tennessee for the biggest challenge of my life.

Creative,Save Port Townsend's Rose Theatre,"Port Townsend, WA",187425.0,160000.0,84,1.6K,5.5K,"“Old theatres are irreplaceable...I think a town’s old theatres are the sanctuary of its dreams.” - Roger EbertOn March 15th the historic Rose Theatre in Port Townsend, WA shut its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no re-opening date in sight. There is no additional federal funding. Without help the Rose Theatre will remain closed forever.Why GoFundMe?Since mid-March we have been able to cover fixed expenses with savings, 3 loans, 1 federal grant, 4 movie theater grants, temporary rent abatement, donations, movie streaming, and gift card, membership and popcorn sales. But it's not enough. (Our federal PPP loan application was denied). This GoFundMe goal would sustain us for six months.

Our StoryThe Rose opened in 1907 as a vaudeville house; it has seen the transition from silent film to talkies, and from Technicolor to digital projection. Located in the heart Port Townsend's National Historic District, it serves as one of the major cultural hubs of the Olympic Peninsula, offering a wide variety of independent, classic, foreign and Hollywood films, in addition to simulcasts from New York's Metropolitan Opera, Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and plays from the National Theatre of London; as well as an annual dance film festival and arts film series. It also serves as the hub for the annual Port Townsend Film Festival.With its three screens, including the intimate Starlight Room, the Rose brings stories from around the globe to its little corner of the world. Every film is personally introduced; you'll find local cider, beer and kombucha on tap, not to mention popcorn with real butter. (More about the Rose here and here and here and here and here ). What Will Donations Be Used For?Funds from this campaign will directly cover fixed monthly expenses - rent, insurance, utilities, phone, internet, accounting, bookkeeping, security, plus wages for three remaining employees. We don't know how long this state-mandated closure will last; our current fundraising goal would cover expenses until February 2021.Why Can't The Rose Open to Partial Audiences?Jefferson County, WA remains in Phase 2 of the state's phased re-opening for businesses. With Phase 3, movie theaters will be allowed to operate, but only at 25% capacity. Between all 3 of our screens, even a ""sell out"" would equal only 69 people. Operating expenses would exceed income. It's a no-win scenario. We cannot open until we can comfortably and safely invite audiences in with at least 50% capacity. We love our community and staff and will only open when it is safe and advisable.  It is very possible that we may not re-open until 2021....But Do Movie Theaters Even Matter Anymore?There are all kinds of ways to experience art, but we believe sometimes you should enjoy it collectively. The Rose is more than just a movie theater: it is a nexus for the Port Townsend community. We have employed nearly 300 local residents since we renovated and re-opened in 1992. We have hosted weddings, lectures, recitals, memorials, concerts and more. Our popcorn is a frequent dinner for the denizens of P.T. - even if they're not seeing the show. Movies today are viewed on screens of all sizes (and you can stream some of ours at home!), but there is a certain movie magic that can only be experienced as the directors/writers/actors/editors intended it - on the big screen and shared with others. We think the Rose still matters, and hope you do too.Other Ways to Help?-Stream movies via www.rosetheatre.com! Not only is there a curated selection of excellent independent fare, updated weekly, but half of every ticket directly supports the theatre. You can stream from anywhere!-Share this campaign with your friends.-We're currently open every Saturday, selling popcorn from 2:00 - 5:00 at 235 Taylor Street, and would love to say hello.Who We AreThe Rose is a family-owned business. In 1992 Rocky Friedman re-opened the darkened cinema after building owner and contractor Phil Johnson did a meticulous restoration. His daughter, who began tearing tickets when she was 12, assists with the business from her home in New York, where she works as an actress. We have a spectacular staff, some of whom have been with us for over 10 years, and all of us thank you from the bottom of our celluloid hearts for your support. What's NextSince we began streaming movies on our website this spring, we've developed a plan to create a fully integrated online film library, with the same thoughtful curation you'll find on our screens, but available to audiences everywhere. We're hoping to provide a seamless viewing experience, with unique film categories and discounts for our members. Stay tuned for updates.Port Townsend is known as ""The City of Dreams"" and by contributing to this fund, you will directly aid in preserving the sanctuary of those dreams."

Over the subsequent 12 years, it has become a centerpiece of downtown Alameda and a source of pride for all Alamedans. In addition to reinvigorating business and entertainment in the area, the Theatre has also hosted events and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local non-profits, including the Alameda Boys and Girls Club, the Alameda Education Foundation, the Alameda Food Bank, Alameda Hospital, Golden State Warriors Children’s / Community Foundation, and the Tee Shirt league, and dozens of others. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Theatre has been entirely shut down since March. Since then, the ownership has utilized all of the Federal and local government support available to maintain the facility. Those funds are now running out and with no re-opening timeframe being discussed for theatres, it’s time for the community to rally to support this iconic Alameda landmark.Even though the Theatre is closed, bills like utilities, insurance, and basic maintenance do not stop: It takes $25,000 per month just to sustain the business until it can re-open.Please help our beloved Theatre make it through these unprecedented times!Statement from the Conner Family:I moved  my family to this amazing Island City in 2006 to build the Alameda Cineplex and renovate and re-open the landmark Historic Alameda Theatre.  We love living in Alameda and kiss the sky every day.  We have experienced 14 incredible years here and 12 even more incredible years as the operator and care taker of this magical facility we call the Alameda Theatre & Cineplex!  We want to thank every one in Alameda for their support and patronage over the years, these have been great and memorable years.  I recognize clearly that we are care takers of this unique beautiful facility and it will be here when I am gone, my promise and commitment is to pass this historic magical palace on to the next generation better than I found it and better than it is now – Covid or no Covid!  It is the community we serve that makes this such a special place, without the support of the community we would have never been able to get the project done in the first place and certainly would not have enjoyed and celebrated 12 years of delivering the magic of movies and special events to this Island City.  We are temporarily closed now as you all know, Covid-19 has touched every person in the entire world in some way.  We will prevail, and we will re-open stronger than ever!Thank you Alameda, we will see you at the movies soon!"

The fire decimated the two small communities of Phoenix and Talent. Many people lost their homes, studios, farms and business. Many in the glass community are displaced with no resources. Including a well known studio in Phoenix called the DoJo. I am a glass artist that goes by the name of LaceFace and I was born and raised here in the Rouge Valley. I am assembling a team to help reach out to anybody in the community that needs help. This includes partnering with Big Country to try and get displaced artists, a place to work and the equipment they need to do so. Our priority will be to make sure people have shelter, water, food, and a way to pay their bills in the immediate future. These resources will not only go to glass artists, but also to anyone in the community who is in need, including collectors, store owners, photographers, farmers and the like.  We all know that the glass community is much bigger than just the artists. It takes many people working together to create the beautiful culture and community we have today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting our community in this time of need."

Launching careers in music, comedy, and spoken word, the club has been a mainstay in the entertainment industry and has come to be an important part of the fabric that makes Greenwich Village such a vital part of NYC lore and history. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Bitter End, like many live venues in NYC, is facing tremendous financial struggle as we try to reopen our doors. We are now reaching out to the world to help us keep this iconic music club alive. We have provided the stage and environment that has helped countless entertainers hone their crafts. From Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, John Prine and Lady Gaga, to Billy Crystal, George Carlin, and Jon Stewart, we have had countless entertainers begin their careers with us who have then gone on to become great performers and pillars in their fields. Thousands of artists have graced our stage over the past six decades. Nurturing the entertainment community has always been our goal and we hope to continue this tradition and add to this long list of successes.
 
The rich history contained within her walls is unparalleled, and to see the doors shut forever would be a shame and a tragedy. Make no mistake, The Bitter End is still a NYC music Mecca. It’s a place where new and established artists alike nurture, develop, and showcase their acts. It’s a place where top national musicians can hold weekly jams, and where up and coming musicians are discovered. It’s a place where singers, songwriters, comedians, rappers, and poets can enjoy a weekly open mic. It’s a gathering place for NYC’s top working artists to hang out before or after a gig for a drink, as well as watch their colleagues perform. It’s a place where you, music lovers, are invited to witness this magic. It’s a place that has survived decades of change and disaster because it deserved to, and still  deserves to, just as much today as it ever did.
 
We all want to return to a world as close to normal as it was before. A world without the Bitter End just doesn’t seem normal at all to us who have been lucky enough to work here. We hope it doesn’t seem normal to you, either.
 
Most of you have spent the past months giving while you weren’t getting, and it isn't easy to ask for help like this in any circumstance. We do thank you all for contributing to our earlier GoFundMe page that asked to help our dedicated staff. We pray you are able to help out one more time. Please help preserve The Bitter End, a precious treasure of a music landmark that has influenced and contributed to the culture of music and the arts all over the world. We would love nothing more than to continue this long standing tradition."

As is well known, the political revolution in Oromia was sparked and led by the young men and women of the qubee generation, likewise, Kello Media was created and led by a group of dedicated Oromo youth in the diaspora. In a little over a year, we have worked to realize that vision and become an inclusive, pacesetting platform for the people of Oromia and beyond. We have strived to bring our people something new that they will not see on other media platforms while at the same time never compromising on our Oromummaa.It has always been our view that Kello Media will be one of the gifts that the qeerroo of the Qubee generation will leave behind for Oromia and her people. Our people’s reception has been overwhelmingly positive and we have only made it this far due to their consistent and unyielding moral support. We have now been able to begin satellite broadcasts to Oromia, increase our output capacity, improve our technology and build a home-based staff.But just as we have reached this stage, we are now seeing an attack on free media in Oromia, some of which has been directed at us through the Ethiopian government’s propaganda wing on social media. As such, we are taking measures to expand and secure Kello Media to take it into a position that will ensure that our people’s free access to our content cannot be hindered. This involves securing a backup satellite and expanding our staff in Oromia. As this operation is urgent and costly, we are turning to our diaspora community to aid us financially.We are confident that our community will continue in its steadfast and strong support of Kello Media. We are all aware of the dire circumstances freedom of the press and freedom of speech face in Ethiopia today, it is up to all of us to take a stand. Thank you.KELLO TEAM"

They sold it in 2001 and in 2005 the upstairs Altar Room was converted into a movie theater. Two additional screens on the main floor were added followed by the fourth screen which debuted in 2014. Located in the heart of Columbia City’s National Historic District, it serves as one of the major cultural hubs and the only neighborhood theater, offering a wide variety of independent, classic, foreign, and Hollywood films, in addition to simulcasts broadcasts. With its four screens, including the intimate lounge upstairs, the Ark brings stories from around the globe to its little corner of the world. You will find a local flavor, a relaxed vibe, and friendly staff.   A movement to restore the vitality of one of our oldest Seattle neighborhoods known for its love of arts and culture, and entertaining nightlife; from cinema and theater to local galleries and life-size wall murals, a community full of art is a community full of culture. Research has even shown that cities that emphasize art have more civic and social engagement, better child welfare and even lower poverty rates. Stimulating Business.

We need your help to make this dream a reality.Why GoFundMe?https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/when-theaters-reopen-will-people-return-seattle-moviehouse-operators-wrestle-with-the-unknown/ Since mid-March we have been able to cover fixed expenses with savings, and creative budgeting. We want to reopen our doors at the end of this Pandemic and reveal a new look, a more inclusive theater, a gathering space for families and an “after dark” club atmosphere to indulge in arts, cinema, music, wine, and petite entrees. Truly a “SYMPHONY FOR YOUR SENSES”  This GoFundMe goal would not only sustain us to have our staff return to work, but also allow for the upgrades that we are in need of to make the space more functional and inviting. Our auspicious goal is to one day own the property to ensure that we will always have a movie and arts venue right here in Columbia City. What Will Donations Be Used For?Funds from this campaign will directly cover the renovation of the theater; adding much needed ADA accessible features, a beautiful, vibrant, and welcoming marquee to bring a renewed feel to the historic building and new seating. It will also allow us to catch up on some of our fixed expenses while the theater has been closed since Mid-March. Why Can't the Ark Lodge Cinema Open to Partial Audiences?King County, WA remains in Phase 2 of the state's phased re-opening for businesses. With Phase 3, movie theaters will be allowed to operate, but only at 25% capacity. Operating expenses would exceed income. It is a no-win scenario. We cannot open until we can comfortably and safely invite audiences back. We love our community and staff and will only open when it is safe and advisable.  It is very possible that we will not reopen until the fall of 2021. In the meantime, though, this allows us to do the renovations, the upgrades and prepare to reopen our doors safely with a brand-new look. But Do Movie Theaters Even Matter Anymore?There are all kinds of ways to experience art, but we believe sometimes you should enjoy it collectively. The Ark Lodge Cinema is more than just a movie theater: it is a hub for the arts in this community. We have employed local residents since our opening. We continue to add new features to attract a more diverse population. With the upcoming renovation we will be adding a wine and beer bar, a small catering kitchen to serve petite entrees, tapas, and appetizers. We will have private events, live music “after dark.” Our goal is to provide you a gathering place; a place away from home where you come to meet with friends and mix and mingle with neighbors. Movies today are viewed on screens of all sizes (and you can stream some of ours at home!), but there is a certain movie magic that can only be experienced as the directors/writers/actors/editors intended it - on the big screen and shared with others.

Creative,Deeds for AIRs,"New York, NY",52684.0,60000.0,72,463,123,"10/20/20Dear Supporters of Deeds for AIRs:Yayyyy !!! Thank you for your support!Updates: We have reached 41K towards our goal!! As stated, our plan is to disperse these funds first as seed funding of 2.5K to each individual Artist-in-Resident to use to their own discretion. For Angel, Donte, Danyele, Stev, and Bertho — these initial seed funds will support the investment into avenues like down payments on courses in culinary certification, a car, and their artistic practices! It’s happening <3As planned: The remaining funds will be used towards the investment in housing outside of the city for some, while others have decided that new prospects for employment and their creative practice ties them to locate housing in NYC. We understand that this has pivoted from the collective purchase, and believe that this shift will permit the access each AIR has been working towards the last few months to pursue their social, personal, and professional goals on their own terms.We are on the search for appropriate subsidized housing that will allow AIRs to have a sustainable accommodation for the long-term!!Moving Forward: We intend to keep the GoFundMe open for the remainder of the year to hopefully reach our intended 60K goal! Please continue to amplify and donate towards our cause to provide holistic assistance and mutual aid this group, and their communities! We’ve made this gmail: [email redacted]To hear from you, communicate about next steps, stay connected about our developments as we actualize our futures! If you wanna contribute words, please hit us up here ^Until soon,AIRs + People’s Space + PSNYP.S. We have made an LLC: Deeds for AIRs for LLC to continue to realize how this structure of getting real aid through the artistic community can become realized, more robust, and more possible. We are happy that AIRs and members of People’s Space will continue to steward this endeavor as we move onward to bigger and wilder imaginations for a future where we win!----------------[original post]Help us provide housing for Black and trans, housing-insecure artists! During the month of June, in the midst of the BLM protests in New York, Angel, Danyele, Donte, Rj, and Stev – the Artists in Residents (AIRs)—were invited by People’s Space — a group of artists from our 02020 initiative—to work with Performance Space New York. What started as a project to offer refuge for protesters quickly shifted to a mutual aid space for those facing houselessness. After securing temporary housing for the AIRs, it soon became apparent that the five artists needed a more permanent solution.People’s Space and Performance Space are now helping the AIRs raise funds to collectively purchase a home outside of NYC, and to provide seed funding for their artistic careers. With your support, the AIRs will be able to secure both long-term housing for themselves and eventually other houseless, Black and trans artists.Help us raise $60,000 by October 20 to lift up impacted communities and most of all, help keep them safe, sustained and supported!The donation will not go to Performance Space; 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the AIRs."
Creative,Trumpet is my Weapon (Gun Exchange Program),"New Orleans, LA",44985.0,6500.0,131,746,4.4K,"The Trumpet is My Weapon Gun Exchange Program is raising money to purchase trumpets which are about $250 each and music books to exchange for guns from New Orleans youth. On Monday, July 13, 2020, a group of children were shot and injured while playing outside their home, with one of the kids, a 9-year-old male, being murdered.  As the father of a 9 year old son, I thought how easy it could have been for that to be my own son.  Much like a lot of the gun violence happening in my city by young people, it is heartbreaking to know and see this happening to our kids.  My thoughts and actions immediately went to how can I contribute to reducing the chances of the continuation of this level of gun violence amongst our youth. 

So I opened Instagram and posted  “To all youth in New Orleans, Bring me a gun and I’ll give you a trumpet.  No questions asked!”Once kids started reaching out with guns I realized I would be able to get a few guns off the street.   A lot of people reached out to see how they can help, that’s where this fundraiser comes in.  The more instruments we have the more guns we can collect.  Once guns are collected they will be turned over to New Orleans Police Department and dismantled.    As a child, and adolescent who grew up in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, I have experienced and engaged in things that individuals at that age should not have to endure.  What saved me and redirected my path was a trumpet, the music, and culture of the city that it connected me with.  It showed me that success, connections, and differences can be managed through self-expression.  When I needed money to take care of myself, I played my horn in the French Quarters for tips and eventually that grew into a full on music career traveling the world.  If I became upset I expressed that through song.  The trumpet became a weapon that really saved my life, so I figured it may be able to have the same impact for another young person from New Orleans. The Trumpet Is My Weapon is a mantra that I have used over the years.  I began using that mantra because the trumpet really became my weapon and tool for my success.  It has opened doors and sent me places that as a kid from the Lower 9th Ward,  statistics say I should have never been.  The goal of The Trumpet Is My Weapon Campaign and Gun Exchange Program is to put trumpets, and eventually other instruments, in the hands of our kids so that they can use it as their weapon and tool for success while taking guns off the street at the same time.  With a communal effort we can make a difference in the lives of others.  Even one life saved is a step in the right direction.Proceeds  from “Trumpet is my weapon” merchandise at TrueOrleans.com will used to offset costfor Trumpet is my Weapon programs"
Creative,Ferguson Rises: A Racial Healing Documentary,"Oakland, CA",43980.0,160000.0,160,496,1.7K,"After 5 years of persistent work and commitment to our labor of love, we are THIS CLOSE to finishing our film Ferguson Rises. Can you contribute to help us raise our finishing funds? We need between $144,000 and $160,000 to get to the finish line.Why does this matter?Before an explosive global uprising condemned the murder of George Floyd, there was a small town in Missouri that erupted in protest after the murder of Mike Brown Jr. As it was in Ferguson, so it has been again around the world: tanks in the streets, tear gas and rubber bullets fired at peaceful protesters, storefronts engulfed in flames, and everywhere the clear and courageous voices of people who can no longer tolerate the scourges of racism and police brutality. The scale of the uprising has grown, but the broken heart and defiant soul of the movement is the same. What can the world learn from a protest like this? And how can we begin to come together to create a new world in its aftermath?These difficult but important questions are explored in our paradigm-shifting, documentary film Ferguson Rises. Beyond the media sensationalism and simplistic narratives, Ferguson Rises presents diverse perspectives from a sometimes uneasy mix of people in Ferguson, a microcosm of the United States. The lessons of Ferguson are more than just lessons around organizing and civil rights; they are lessons in building community and finding hope in the face of tragedy. These lessons can be instructive to this nation as it attempts to remedy and heal the deep divisions that stand in the way of our recognizing each other’s humanity. What happened to Mike Brown Jr. happened to George Floyd, to Breonna Taylor, and happens every 28 hours to another African American at the hands of police, security guards, and vigilantes. More ""Fergusons"" will continue to happen unless we all stand up and do something to end the underlying conditions of racism and injustice that cause this. As we march and pass legislation, let’s not forget the power of film to keep the message of justice alive, long after the streets are cleared. Support Ferguson Rises in being that film and that voice!What your contribution goes towards:Your contribution will be directly used to pay our team to get this project done.

“Last November, I took over sole ownership of the club to continue to give a voice and a room for us to prosper, share and grow together.  I have been blessed in the local, national and international music community for many years and this is my opportunity to give back.  My vision in taking over the club was to buy the building so we can continue to bring light, love and music for years to come. This was also a vehicle to secure a future for my family and me as well as to continue to honor my mentor's legacy, Mr. Randy Hien of The Living Room. I am not comfortable asking for help in raising funds for a down payment, but it is our only option.  So many amazing artists and musicians have reached out to me to ask how they can help.  I know in these trying times that funds are tight - all of your support and generosity are truly appreciated.”

Please help keep Juice alive – keep the voice of the people alive and independence alive.” – Jim Murphy, Juice Magazine Skate EditorThis is Shannon Smith, aka sk8mom, from Charleston, SC, with a call to kick down: Juice Magazine has always stayed true to our culture – constantly giving back and supporting our scene and skate family. They have been instrumental in communicating our culture in an honest way and have never been compromised or sold out. To our great advantage, they have always found a way to get the information, inspiration and stoke to us come hell or high water. Now they could use a little back up, so please donate…Our friend, Terri Craft, started Juice Magazine with $500 and a dream, and it has become an ongoing experiment of how the independent spirit can thrive and survive. Juice's commitment to our community has let us all enjoy the results of their passion, along with the help of the talented and dedicated contributors, advertisers, subscribers, editors, writers, photographers, designers, skate shops, surf shops, music stores, friends and family, which are the backbone of Juice. As they were on the way to printing their upcoming edition of Juice Magazine, they were hit by the effects of the suspension of business due to the coronavirus pandemic, now they are in a FINANCIAL CRISIS and need your assistance. The economic limitations imposed by this unexpected pandemic could crush their dreams and our core source of connecting with our surf/skate/music family.Please check out the following accolades, write ups, and straight facts of their ongoing work and how much has been achieved in our scene over these past 26 years. All of these successes and achievements have happened because of their work to honor us all. You know what you gotta do - so thanks in advance and keep rollin.Shannon =============https://youtu.be/wBZvJEIe51o=============NOTE FROM TERRI CRAFT - JUICE MAGAZINE OWNER/PUBLISHER/EDITOR=============""When I started Juice Magazine 26 years ago, you could count the number of skateparks on one hand and now there are thousands of skateparks all over the world. Two and a half decades ago, skateboarding related charities were non-existent. Today, there are numerous non-profits giving back to skateboarding in many vital ways. One of the most important differences between now and then is that, 26 years ago, there was a clear division between old school and new school skateboarding. Now that wall of separation has followed the same path as the Berlin Wall, allowing for an unprecedented unification of skateboarders all over the globe. Great strides have been made for girls that skate as well as the acceptance of skate history and long overdue recognition for skateboarding’s pioneers and its artifacts. At the same time, the current generation of skateboarders is taking skateboarding to new heights, previously unimaginable. Skateboarding is as diverse as the skateboarders that are addicted to it and the state of skate is strong. It has been the greatest honor to be part of the skate, surf, art and music family over the last quarter of a century and I just want to thank you all for the opportunity and for all of your support. I know these times are rough for everyone, so please know how much I believe in you. I hope you are staying safe and well out there and thank you for caring, sharing and contributing! Peace, love and respect always...============NOTE FROM DAN LEVY – JUICE MAGAZINE ASSISTANT EDITOR AND MARKETING DIRECTOR============Terri Craft has been at the helm of Juice Magazine since founding it in 1993 and she has not wavered in her pursuit to preserve the cultural significance of our beloved arts through the ancient archiving format of talk story. Her unbelievable passion to keep Juice Magazine alive for over two and a half decades with no major investment is a testament to her all-in attitude and uncompromising loyalty to documenting skateboarding/music/art and surfing. Juice Magazine is more than paper and ink. It is a beacon of authenticity to skaters, musicians, artists and surfers all over the world. Over the years, Juice has grown into more than just a print magazine, and Terri, with her DIY attitude, figured it out by learning how to build a website, make merchandise, throw events, raise money for charities, help get skateparks built in NYC and Venice Beach and more, all while putting others before herself to keep the celebration of our culture alive. Terri is not one to ask for this type of help, however, after all she has done for all of us, we are asking for your assistance on her behalf. With your help, Juice Magazine will remain an independent voice, shining the light on those who deserve it, while remaining a forum of open and honest communication for us to share our love for skateboarding, music, art and surfing worldwide. Skateboarding is the family we choose and when you have family you can get through anything. Juice Magazine now needs your help to keep music, surf, skate, art journalism and advocacy alive during this difficult time. The COVID-19 virus shuttered the Venice Beach Skatepark as well as live music and cultural events here in Venice: including many of our music venues, bars and restaurants; festivals and concerts; art shows and skateboarding events. The virus has also temporarily suspended events at our Venice Beach based location and our print edition of Juice Magazine is temporarily on hold until Barnes & Noble resumes accepting shipments of magazines, so our ability to stay alive is threatened.  Your donation will help us to keep Juice Magazine up and running and help to keep our skateboarding, surfing, art, music advocacy alive and strong. Please consider a donation, and thank you most gratefully!============QUOTES ABOUT JUICE...============Here are just a few words of kindness and encouragement that have kept us going over the years…“JUICE has the Juice. More than a magazine. A community of humans that do it! Juice is BADASS!!!” – CHUCK DUKOWSKI""Juice Magazine has been a voice for core skateboarding, music, and art for over 25 years. They did their first feature on me in 1998, and we’ve worked together many times over the years. Running a print mag is always a tough business for love, not money, but is especially challenging during a pandemic. Juice is in financial distress, and I want to help and pay my proper respects to style in skateboarding, but also paying my respects to authentic voices in skateboard culture who chronicle the past and the future. I will be releasing art soon with proceeds to help Juice stay in business, but for now, they have a GoFundMe and you can support to keep them in print. Thanks for caring!” – SHEPARD FAIREY“JUICE is the truest mag out there period.” – TIM JACKSON“Please contribute to help keep Juice Magazine alive! In this information age where stories and pictures are not much more than a blip on a screen, there’s something special about having a magazine in your hand, reading the words printed on paper, and giving the info time to sink in. Juice has never sold out and it has truly made an art form of documenting the history of hard-core music, skating, surfing, park building, art, and the outside of the box lifestyle that our culture and community is formed from. The people behind Juice have dedicated their lives to bringing you this important information and should be supported like the family that they are. Thanks.” – GRINDLINE SKATEPARKS""I can’t believe how great the interviews are in your mag. It’s like the Surfer’s Journal of skateboard culture. Thanks.” – GREG ESCALANTE“You’re doing a good job with Juice. It reminds me of the early days of Thrasher.” – FAUSTO VITELLO“Juice Magazine is the best, the most authentic with the most integrity for 26 years.

Please donate.” – NYC SKATE COALITION“Juice is the best skateboarding magazine I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen them all.” – JIM BARNUM – SPECTRUM SKATEPARKS“Juice is family, not just a magazine or a place to crash in Venice.

I love you guys.” – BILL DANFORTH“Juice Magazine has done so much for skateboarding, keeping the core of it alive, and now it is time for us to stand up and help our skateboard brothers and sisters. We must make sure this magazine stays out there and show our appreciation for their dedication to skateboarding. Even if it's just a dollar, it will all add up. Everything begins with one step, so do what you can, like they've always done for skateboarding and I thank all of you on behalf of Juice Magazine for your support.” – JESSE MARTINEZ“Good job people! Finally a mag that doesn’t just ooze industry/corporate sleaze from every page. Good idea to interview people who build and do stuff rather than just the new flavor of the week shoe pro.” – RED “Everyone has the same opinion of your mag it's the best damn mag anywhere!” – STEVE HERRING“We at Made In Venice Movie believe in community, as do our friends at Juice Magazine. They have kept their mag going for 26 years independently and now they need our community to come together and help. Please donate to them if you have the ability.

It’s always a big thrill to discover a new one ! You’ve raised a kind of Dream Team through the years and you’re now so far away from other trivial publishers, that there’s no comparison possible.

If you can chip in, let’s show our friends some love!” - BRIAN AVERILL“Pools, Pipes and Punk Rock. Terri and Dan of Juice Magazine have been my family for the past 15 years. I’ve witnessed first hand their unrelenting dedication to the skate, music, art and surf world. They are a pilLar to this community, ALWAYS giving. I know personally, that they live and breath, giving every single part of their existence, selflessly, to this community. I’ve seen them hit really hard times, when life might be easier to just throw in the towel, but they’ve never given up and they still keep giving back. Their intention behind it is 100 pure and old school and NOTHING less. I know most of us are hitting hard times ourselves, but if you feel any connection to this, and have a lil extra to help out, please do. We need to keep this magazine alive. When so much is changing in the world, not even talking about Covid, but technology and the internet is taking over, it feels good to hold this printed magazine in your hands, read thru the interviews and look at bitching photos. Next time you read an issue of Juice, know that there are a LOT of blood, sweat and tears that go into it. A whole lotta LOVE, too. I’ve honestly never known anyone as dedicated to something as these two. Terri started this mag 26 years ago and she’s given everything she’s got to it. Literally everything. Let’s keep JUICE alive!! Help if you can. Thanks!” – KAIT NADINE“Another great issue! I read the thing cover to cover to cover to cover and it will still take me a few months to fully absorb the thing. I know y'all go through hell trying to get each issue out but no other rag comes even close!!! Kill photos! The interviews are unreal. The Best Mag in the world. You guys rule the pool!!!!” - MERK“Juice is a crucial contemporary and historical source for the whole skate/surf/punk rock/art scene worldwide and founded, owned and edited by Terri Craft along with the multitalented Dan Levy. They are based in Venice Beach and create Juice with a totally independent spirit and approach to living life with an artistic integrity that is hard to maintain these days.” – DOUG MENUEZ“Juice is a lifesaver for me – the super long interviews and sheer amount of information in Juice has got me through many a long subway commute here in Japan. Cheers mate! Kind Regards.” – ROBERT – JAPAN“Juice Magazine has always been a pillar of support for our community of surfers and skaters. When someone needed help, they were their voice. Now they need our help. Any amount will hep to keep them going another 26 years strong."" – KELLY BARNES""Our community in venice is very tight.we need to take care of those that have taken care of us.

Dependably awesome work. I have just gotten through the first cover to cover read of the last issue and I must say again that it will be well reviewed until I can scope the next. I just can’t get enough. Thanks again for making real skateboarding information available. You never fail to leave me speechless. You are the truth, the life and the hopeless skate-addicts lifeline to Utopia. Thanks again.” – BARRY STRACHAN – AUSTRALIA""Juice Magazine is arguably the very heart and soul of Venice, California. They have been documenting the skate, surf, and music scenes around the world since 1993, and a lot of the town's cool can be easily traced back to Juice. Publisher/Editor/Owner, Terri Craft, and Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, have been bringing everyone the Juice for over 26 years, and now it's time to return the favor... Juice Magazine is pretty much the Bible to so many in the skate world, not only in Venice, but around the world ... Venice just gets to call them our own. So many awesome times have originated with Juice ... from skate contests to ragers at the Juice headquarters, from epic art exhibitions like Beyond The Streets to little art shows in local galleries. From collaborations with the California Locos and Shepard Fairey (and a new print for Juice is coming very soon by Fairey in another effort to fundraise - how cool!) to showcasing the work of local and coming up artists - and bands and writers and everyone who gets and appreciates the Juice vibe... They were fundamental in helping to get the Venice Skatepark built, as well as getting the documentary about it made - Made In Venice is crucial viewing for anyone who cares about skating and/or Venice. We have already lost so much from this awful virus, don't let it happen to one of the very best things about Venice/the skate/surf/art/music world. I miss being in Venice so much right now, and the Juice family is one of the things I miss the very most. PLEASE let it still be there when I get back. PLEASE let us now have their back. One more time, you may donate HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping to bring so many more awesome times to us all! You're awesome too. LONG LIVE JUICE!"" – CJ GRONNER - BLOGTOWN================JUICE HISTORY================Juice Magazine is dedicated to documenting the heart and soul of skateboarding, surfing, music, art and culture. Through its print magazine, website, social media, skate contests, music events, art shows, Dogtown Chronicles, Alva Collection, Duty Now For the Future Series, Bones Brigade Chronicles, Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf & Skate Symposiums, Juice Surf Skate Culture Collection Shows, Five and Alive at Riverside, Venice Skatepark Contests, Guinness World Record Wall Ride, Juice Drop In Shows, Juice Live, Venice Skateboard Culture Experiences, fundraisers for charities and skateboarding events, and its commitment to help get a skatepark built in Venice, California and raise funds for Andy Kessler’s 108 Riverside Skatepark in New York City, NY, Juice has endeavored to support the surf/skate/music community worldwide for over a quarter of a century. In 1993, in Wilmington, North Carolina, the first issue of Juice Magazine was created with a $500 start-up family loan. After receiving a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from UNC-Wilmington, Terri Craft saw the need for a magazine with extensive coverage of the burgeoning music, skate and surf scene. The music, surf, and skate combination soon grabbed hold of the marketplace and the Juice presence was established. After write-ups in Rolling Stone, Men’s Journal, Thrasher, TransWorld Business, TransWorld Skateboarding and Entrepreneur, Craft was even more encouraged to pursue her dream. From the start, Juice has focused on unique content, and discovering unsung talent in the music, skate, art and surf communities while paying respect to its pioneers and innovators. With street teams spreading the word, Juice firmly ensconced itself as an essential periodical for the surf/skate/music audience and expanded its distribution to the entire East Coast. In addition, Juice launched the first Juice compilation CD, in 1995, and participated in numerous trade shows including SxSW, Surf Expo, Magic, and the CMJ Music Marathon, as well as the debut of the Warped Tour.In June 1996, Juice created its first annual music and sports conference, the Mid-Atlantic Sound Surf and Skate Symposium. M.A.S.S.S ‘96 included over 100 bands, 30 pro skateboarders, an independent film festival, music seminars, and interactive Internet broadcasting by SonicNet, which attracted top music industry executives and over 7,000 attendees.  In July of 1996, Juice Magazine launched a second Juice office in New York City, and immediately attracted over 80 freelancers nationwide. As a direct result, Juice strengthened its editorial voice and established new relationships with national advertisers. After expanding distribution, Juice witnessed immediate response as the national ad ratio increased from 20 to 50 percent. Juice also dove into one of the most challenging markets, New York City, and successfully progressed from a regional to a national publication with retailers across the country in 41 states, as skate legends, Jim Murphy and Andy Kessler, joined the Juice team as Skate Editors.In 1997, Juice hosted the second annual M.A.S.S.S. showcasing 175 bands, skateboarding demos, a fashion awards show, recording industry mentor sessions, surfing contests, a VW smash-up and dune buggy show and an additional outdoor stage. The Juice skateboarding street course and Juice vert ramp featured professional skateboarder Tony Hawk as well as over 40 other pro skaters.  As a result, attendance at M.A.S.S.S. 1997 sailed over the 10,000 mark. Sponsors, Pepsi-Cola, Miller Brewing and Eastern Skateboard Supply were extremely pleased, as was the community, as millions of dollars in hotel and restaurant revenues poured in for the week long event. In NYC, Dan Levy joined Juice as Assistant Editor and Ad Sales Director bringing expertise as a skateboarder and skatepark owner to the team.In 1998, planning began for Urban Phenomenon, a monumental music concert and skateboarding event, which took place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics. Juice was chosen to organize the skateboarding for this landmark occasion, gathering together over 110 of the world’s best pro skateboarders. The concert featured Run-DMC, Brand Nubian, 808 State and Mix Master Mike as well as the Red Bull vert ramp and became a launching ground for the Tony Hawk Pro Skater Video Game. In September 1999, Juice Magazine expanded once again with a new office in the heart of multi-cultural and creative Venice, California, in order to more fully capture the advertising base on the West Coast. Due to this expansion, without additional staffing, the publishing schedule was modified from eight to four issues per year in order to continue to make the best magazine every time. Juice also stepped in to champion the fight for a public skatepark in Venice, developing relationships with the City of Los Angeles and working to strengthen bonds in the local community. In June 2000, Juice began its foray into documentary filmmaking with a 7-day excursion to Hawaii with skate and surf legends including Tony Alva, to capture footage for “Along For the Ride.” At the same time, a dynamic line up of surf and skate legends joined the Juice editorial crew, including: Steve Olson, Jay Adams, Christian Hosoi, Jeff Ho, Herbie Fletcher and Dibi Fletcher.After seven years of being a free publication, Juice made the transition to a paid circulation in December 2000 with an introductory cover price of $2.00. In February 2002, Juice was picked up for newsstand distribution by one of the largest magazine distributors in the country, servicing over 9,500 locations, including Barnes & Noble and Borders. Juice then began distribution with a specialty distributor for independent book and music stores at $3.99 cover price. Skate legend, Dave Duncan, also joined Juice in 2002.In 2004, Juice invested in an extensive website and began to build its social media audience across multiple platforms. Juice began to increase international distribution in Germany, Japan and France. Juice also presented the first ever Guinness World Record Wall Ride Contest for skateboarding at Hollywood + Highland, in Los Angeles, California.In 2008, circulation was adjusted from 30,000 to 25,000, after the closing of Borders, and the Juice print publishing schedule and advertising rates were reconfigured in reaction to the economic recession hitting the country. In response to this reality, Juice introduced consulting, public relations, event planning and social media services to its repertoire. In October 2009, the Venice Skatepark officially opened in Venice, California, an astonishing victory at the end of a long fight to make the skatepark a reality. Juice helped to organize the Skatepark Grand Opening with the City of Los Angeles, and began hosting frequent skateboarding events and contests. In 2010, Juice launched its event series, the Juice Magazine Surf Skate Culture Collection, featuring contemporary and vintage skateboard collections, photography and artwork, transforming the Juice office into a skate/surf/music/art exhibition space. These cultural events also served as fundraisers for Venice locals and non-profits in need of support. In 2011, Juice began an exclusive collaboration with award-winning filmmaker, Stacy Peralta, providing behind the scenes documentation of “Bones Brigade: An Autobiography”, from its first days of filming to its debut at the Sundance Film Festival. Through this exciting partnership, Powell Peralta became one of Juice Magazine’s biggest advertisers, in print and online. In 2012, Juice Sk8Tracks, a digital sampler of punk rock music, was launched to introduce new bands as well as current releases from punk rock legends including Jello Biafra, Wayne Kramer, Fishbone & Meat Puppets.In 2014, Juice developed a collaborative relationship with an artistic conclave called the California Locos: John Van Hamersveld, Norton Wisdom, Dave Tourje, Gary Wong, Chaz Bojorquez, Shepard Fairey, Mister Cartoon, Estevan Oriol, RETNA, SLICK and Robert Williams. This project resulted in a variety of events, video projects, books and art shows.In 2015, Juice launched an online video interview series called “In The Van” in collaboration with revered punk rockers, The Loud Ones. The series finale was celebrated with a Loud Ones concert at Juice headquarters in Venice, California.Juice expanded its outreach into radio in 2016 through a project with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, and KLOS 95.5 FM’s Jonesy’s Jukebox Show at the L.A. Times Festival of Books featuring Juice editor and surf/skate icon, Jeff Ho.In 2016, Juice launched its own TV channel on Roku introducing Juice TV to viewers worldwide through a partnership with Barons Media. Juice TV features surf, skate, music and art shows and short films, as well as its “In The Van” series.In the summer of 2016, Juice partnered with internationally-released documentary, “Made In Venice”, featuring the story of the fight to get the Venice Skatepark built. While providing publicity services and social media campaigns, Juice also participated in multiple sold out premieres with the film’s Producer, Dianne Lerner, and distributor, Abramorama.In 2017, Juice was thrilled to work with Shepard Fairey, Glen E. Friedman and Jeff Ho for a behind the scenes video to inform the surf/skate/music/art audience about a special collaboration print featuring the godfather of Dogtown surf & skate. Once the print launched online, it sold out in less than three seconds, one of the fastest selling prints of all time.2018 also saw a vast expansion of the Juice Live Shows on JuiceMagazine.com, including Juice “Drop In” interview shows filmed live from the Juice offices in Venice. The Juice Live Webcam, which offers a 24 Hour A Day live feed from the Venice Beach boardwalk, one of the biggest tourist attractions in America with over 30,000 visitors daily, saw continued growth in 2018. In another expansion of Juice brand awareness, AirBNB Experiences selected Juice Assistant Editor, Dan Levy, to host a rare insider look at Juice world headquarters in Venice with his Dogtown Cultural History tour, which includes a behind the scenes look at the Venice Skatepark and brings international visitors to Juice offices daily. In 2018, Juice partnered with Adidas for Beyond the Streets, the definitive showcase of street and graffiti art in 40,000+ square feet of immersive exhibits celebrating skate, graffiti and music in Los Angeles for a four-month exhibit and sold out shows.In 2019, Juice joined forces with Robert Trujillo to present OTTTO, featuring Tye Trujillo, Brian Ferretti and Jonah Abraham, at the Juice 25 Year Anniversary in Venice Beach sponsored by Vans. In 2019, Juice collaborated with Vans and provided a set location for the Tony Alva Story movie with actor, Josh Brolin. Juice also hosted the Tony Alva movie premiere at the Santa Monica International Film Festival. 2019 also saw Skull Skates launch a Juice collaboration with limited edition skateboards and apparel celebrating Juice 25 Years and Skull Skates 40th year.In 2020, Juice continues to add to its client list, with the addition of The Waterfront Venice and The Winston House, two of the most popular hotspots in Venice Beach, California, and was in the process of planning a series of skateboarding contests and music events in California and beyond, when the coronavirus hit... ===========COMMUNITY & PHILANTHROPY: ===========Juice has always believed in giving back.

Creative,Galaxy Fund,"Minneapolis, MN",42186.0,50000.0,169,333,104,"ABOUT THE GALAXY FUNDFrom nothing to something, a prototype fund focused on the earliest stage of development. Sometimes the initial barriers are the hardest to overcome.  My name is Evva Karr and as the founder and final boss of GLITCH, I’ve heard it all before when launching projects like HyperDot  and Power Leveling   -- “it’s too risky,” “the market is unproven,” or “talk to us when you’re closer to launch.” There’s always an excuse and most people aren’t interested in financing bold new ideas and early stage experiments -- especially from BIPOC, women, and queer founders. Equity begins at the foundership level and the Galaxy Fund has been created to address this financing gap for BIPOC, women, and queer-led studios. Starting right now with a $50,000 raise for a fierce group of five Black women and queer founders. The funding will be given as an unrestricted prototype grant for each founder to use however they see fit for themselves and their business -- child care, hardware, software, part-time staff, coaching, legal, therapy. Let’s fund the next prototypes for these exceptional artists and wait at the edge of our seats for the groundbreaking worlds they will build and share with us.I’ll be personally matching up to $10,000 and encourage those who can do the same to reach out to me and pledge as well. If we reach our goal, then we’ll add more Black women and queer founders to this campaign and keep going.

Devastation hits the nonprofit Surflight Theater hard for the second time this summer. First it was the Coronavirus then it was Tropical Storm Isaias. A successful inventive outdoor season was well underway with the musical Cabaret just having closed, many Children's Theatre shows having played, Frozen Jr and Mamma Mia about to open. The gale force winds did them in by destroying their outdoor tent, collapsing entirely the venue, stage, props and the electrics light and sound equipment. Everyone is safe which is most important. Please pray that they get through this terrible year, and get back on their feet as soon as possible!! They are hoping to be back up and running this week. Remember, through all of this turmoil, their bills aren't going to stop while the plays and shows do and equipment gets replaced. Insurance will help some but not enough. Please make a donation to help keep them afloat and help them to return better and stronger!!. Any size donation would be appreciated. What you think might be an amount too small and won't make a difference to them, is totally incorrect. Remember, every little bit counts!More information about Ocean Professional Theatre Co: The Mission of Ocean Professional Theatre Company (dba Surflight Theatre) is to provide first quality professional theatre for the residents of and visitors to Southern New Jersey while providing a training ground for the next generations of theatre artists."

Monthly expenses are high because we aren’t just a restaurant or just a music/event venue, but both.  Therefore, our costs are high to cover the basic expenses of the unique nature of GCA.  We will not reopen until it is clearly safe to do so. We will not jeopardize the health of our staff or our community.  Opening part way is not financially viable.So we are asking for your help.  Our goal is $70,000 to remain viable for 6-7 months.  Our hope is by then it will be safe and the world will be in a much better place.  Our plan is to reopen bigger and busier than ever.  We are asking for help from our community and those from afar that support independent venues. OUR STORY 'TIL NOW-Gateway City Arts, in downtown Holyoke, MA., began 9 years ago when my partner, a professional art restorer and artist, needed a new studio space.  After a long search for affordable space we fell in love with a mill building in Holyoke. We have a beautiful building with a total of 40,000 square foot in a diverse and challenged city in Western MA. The city has a rich history and amazing potential.  We decided to buy the building and create a community, art and cultural center.  We put our hearts, time, sweat, money and tears into creating this multi-functional venue.  We had to totally redo the building to bring it up to code. Our opening helped bring other new businesses to the area, thus greatly contributing to the beginning of the revitalization of the downtown.  What began as a small art venue for studios and classes has morphed into a restaurant with food and alcohol, event spaces, live theater, and a world class music venue for local, national and internationally touring bands.  GCA is a destination and brings thousands of people to the area annually.Vitek, my partner, comes from the Czech Republic and his training is in restoring castles, cathedrals, buildings and creating/restoring fine art.  My background is totally different- I am a Physical Therapist by training and discovered art as an adult.  What does this have to do with anything? Our interests and values intersect around people- our desire to be in community, our interest in justice, learning, creating and inspiring.  We began building Gateway (GCA) by doing most of the construction ourselves and it slowly evolved into a complex, multifaceted business with almost 40 employees and volunteers at one point.  They are local, dedicated and believe in our vision.  We worked hard at creating a professional environment in whatever we offer and welcome everyone to our facility.  We grew from small concerts to sell out crowds of 500 people with national touring bands.  GCA is home to a terrific puppeteer company, an alternative theater group, artists, craftsmen, and people from start-up to career professionals in various fields of art, design and performing arts.  And we have events from corporate meetings and retreats to weddings!YOUR HELP WILL KEEP THIS VITAL VENUE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS, THE CITY OF HOLYOKE AND THE PIONEER VALLEY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO KEEP GOING DURING THIS TIME. PLEASE HELP WITH ANY SIZE DONATION--It is more than welcome and extremely appreciated.  THANKS FOR LISTENING-With gratitude,Lori and Vitek#SmallBusinessRelief"
Creative,Fundraise For Lebanon,"San Francisco, CA",37425.0,50000.0,135,18,431,"Hello! Please watch our latest trailer on this link :) WINE and WAR Trailer WINE and WAR is due for global release in September and the film’s collaborators Mark Johnston, Mark Ryan and Michael Karam are pledging up to $50,000* to Cap-Ho, a Lebanese charity that provides much-needed medical care to those without insurance. An amazing journeyTheir adventure began in 2013, when, inspired by Michael Karam’s award-winning book Wines of Lebanon, the trio teamed up with a mission: to change perceptions of the region and explore an enigmatic and misunderstood country by producing a feature length documentary that celebrated Lebanese entrepreneurship in times of conflict and instability through the lens of wine. The film will not only highlight the determination of Lebanon’s winemakers, but also the remarkable story of the Lebanese throughout history. And while the film is called WINE and WAR, the focus is really on a remarkable people, fighting to live and work in difficult conditions very often not of their own making.This unique documentary explains this historical journey, with testimonies from those who fought to make wine in the 1975-90 civil war, the 2006 summer war, and those who continue to produce in the shadow of regional instability. Their astonishing stories tell of bravery, determination, and survival and how wine can be a unifier and a metaphor for life, hospitality, civilization, and a force for good in a region defined by turmoil and animosity.An epic wine cultureLebanon’s relationship with the vine culture stretches back, almost 7,000 years. In the second millennium BC, the Phoenicians, a Canaanite people who inhabited the Levantine coast, created a powerful trading empire that gave the gift of wine to the then known world, including Greece and ancient Rome. They were the first wine merchants!The power of the DiasporaThe Lebanese have continued to travel the world. So while there are 4.5 million people in Lebanon, there are a further 10 million of Lebanese descent scattered across the five continents and they can be instrumental in changing the perception of Lebanon, through a film that can renew a sense of identity and pride among a huge diaspora scattered across the world.A story more relevant now than everBut above all, as we brace ourselves for change not seen in our lifetime, WINE and WAR is a compelling reminder that history is fraught with challenges that have been faced and ultimately overcome. In a region that is not automatically associated with wine, it is a story of epic achievement, one that shows the best side of its humanity, it’s history; it’s tradition of hospitality, and its generosity of spirit.In a time of global angst, when Lebanon is not only dealing with the Covid pandemic, but also fighting corruption, environmental crises and sectarian politics not to mention navigating choppy economic waters, the WINE and WAR is a timely reminder that uncertainty is a way of life for many but that out of uncertainty can come remarkable resilience, and positivity. We need your help With 300 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every minute and 5 billion videos watched every day, we need your help to navigate the blizzard of content that so often blinds us these days. WINE and WAR is finished but we need to raise $50,000 to pay for the marketing of this legacy film.  We could do it for more, or maybe less but the amount will allow us to genuinely achieve a global audience that will show Lebanon in a positive light.  A global movementOur following on Facebook and Instagram, especially in South America is growing quickly and we have produced a short fund-raising film, which highlights our support of Cap-Ho and a “teaser”, both of which are attached. A full “trailer” will follow very shortly. Perceptions are everything today and we have the film to change them, but we need your support to give Lebanon a voice. Please let us know what you think, and if you have any ideas to make this exciting joint initiative more impactful please reach out to us.Lastly here is a link to view the WINE and WAR Trailer *Whatever money is generated from funding raising, up to $50,000, will be matched in a contribution to Cap-Ho from the films revenues"

Creative,Roger Rocka’s and GCP assistance project,"Fresno, CA",37320.0,75000.0,201,238,1.6K,"We all love Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater and Second Space Theater. It might surprise you to know that they are  not great moneymakers. In fact, these two separate (but very connected) businesses run on very  small margins and actually suffer losses on some of their less popular productions. The corona virus has closed these venues indefinitely because of the city's shelter-in-place rules.While Dan and Laurie Pessano, at GCP, and Roger Rocka, who owns the dinner theater, have vowed to re-open as soon as possible, there will likely be major restrictions on public gatherings when they do. The theaters will probably have to open to half capacity to meet state and local requirements. Since they don't make much profit on any show, even with a full house, they will undoubtedly lose money on shows until we get back to our real lives. They need us. Several people have already forfeited their season ticket value to help out; but, even if we all did that, it won't be nearly enough. Please chip in. Our initial  goal is $50,000. If that's not enough, we'll ask again.There are many worthy causes out there, including many non-profit organizations that need your help. We encourage you to give to them as well. But Fresno cannot lose Good Company Players and Roger Rocka's. In the cultural sense, these are our theaters. They give us many hours of joy that cannot be replaced. Please let's give back and support them in this time of need."
Creative,Trans People Are Sacred - 100 Cities Campaign,"Austin, TX",35195.0,152000.0,117,871,5.8K,"TRANS PEOPLE ARE SACREDNATIONAL BILLBOARD CAMPAIGNIn recent months, the Transgender community has been faced with numerous calculated attacks from the current administration. Intentionally regressive policy reform has led to increased systematic discrimination against Trans people. This has led to the loss of vital protections in healthcare, housing, homelessness resources, and the cruel and sudden exclusion of Trans people from military service. These are fundamental human rights, all of which are necessary for our survival.The violent murders of Black Trans Women and Trans Women of Color remain at epidemic levels. In 2020 we have already seen too many brilliant individuals taken from this world by force. The public should be a safe place for Trans and gender non-conforming people to exist freely.It is our goal to reclaim public space for the Trans community.Our bodies are holy ground, our magic is potent and true, and our existence makes the world a more loving and equitable place for all. We have always been here and always will be. We demand safety for our community. We demand the right to exist without being targeted. We demand understanding. We will continue to work tirelessly until these demands are met.Now is the time to bring our light into the world like never before.In July of 2019, Transgender artist and activist Jonah Welch  launched a billboard in Detroit, Michigan, in collaboration with Save Art Space  and Ellen Rutt . The billboard proclaimed ""Trans People Are Sacred,” a phrase that was first shared with Jonah by Dakota Camacho  years earlier while they were residents of the Audre Lorde Cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin.The billboard was intended to strengthen representation and inspire hope for Trans individuals in Detroit, but the piece spread like wildfire. The billboard reached a global audience. The words, Trans People Are Sacred, took root, and catalyzed profound healing for individuals and communities the world over. After the success of the initial billboard, Save Art Space reached out to Jonah Welch to create a national-level project for this work. Now we have the opportunity to spread this message even farther.WE NEED YOUR HELPIt is our goal to place these billboards in one hundred cities across the United States, with a distinct focus on conservative areas in the south and southwest. The billboards will go up between mid-September and mid-October, just weeks before the election, so that our voices can be heard. Because of its inherent accessibility and visibility, it is our belief that public art holds the potential to shift culture. Each $1000 we raise will allow us to place a billboard in another city. The additional $52k will be used to pay 52 Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists $1000 each for their work (50 visual artists and two curators). And while our initial goal is $152k, we hope to exceed this amount and cover the country with this beacon of hope. 

CALL FOR BIPOC ARTISTSWe are dedicating the majority of billboard space to the work of Trans & Non-Binary BIPOC artists. All art must include the phrase ""Trans People are Sacred"" or a culturally-rooted variation on this phrase specific to the artist. (ex: ""Black Trans People are Sacred""). We encourage artists to interpret this phrase through the lens of their ancestral language and culture. Each selected artist will be paid $1000 for their work.The cohort of BIPOC artists will be selected by Dakota Camacho  and Ryan Young . For submission guidelines, to suggest a billboard location, or to inquire about press opportunities please contact Jonah via the Gofundme contact form."

So many celebrities, family, friends, strippers, politicians and more have been inside this limo.  Marilyn Manson famously did donuts outside Vinnie’s “Clubhouse” one time.  Vinnie used to drive it to go shopping, drive-through restaurants, and of course to party ALL THE TIME.I had the honor of partying in it back in 2008 in Dallas, and Vinnie played me some HELLYEAH demos out of his monstrous sound system.  I remember my insides were vibrating so hard from the intense volume and kick from those speakers, goddamn!?Now all these years later, I find myself in a very extraordinary situation, one that I would never imagine.  Being the proud new owner of Vinnie Paul’s limousine?!Vinnie wanted to restore this limo while he was alive, but it cost way too much.  He even contacted a known TV show to help him pimp it out, but they wanted a ton of money to fix it up.  It needs a SHIT TON of work.Getting the limo to California from Vegas has burned a hole through my wallet, along with other expenses that barely got this beast rolling. It’s gonna take a lot to get this on the road again. I need to pay for engine work, body work, paint, transmission, power window/trunk motors, stereo/visual equipment (super important!), tires, wheels, brakes, lights, interior seats/carpet, vinyl roofing, front windshield, sun roof, detailing, registration, insurance, storage, and more costs that I have no idea that will undoubtedly happen.I need your help please.  Here’s where YOU come in.Every dollar donated will go to complete the restoration of the limo that I inherited from my idol Vinnie Paul.If you donate $33 or up you’ll get your name engraved on the inside of the trunk.  It could be your name, your band name, your organization, your company, your pet’s name, or anything you want.  Whatever it is, it’ll be forever immortalized on this iconic piece of rock history. Throughout the limo pimping out process we’ll be updating this page and our socials with cool videos and exclusive content. I can’t do ANY of this without your help.Massive THANX to my brother Sonny Guillen for this great idea after hearing me stress out about how I was going to pay for this stuff.  He convinced me to do this, and I appreciate his assistance in helping me to run and manage this.We know that this is an extremely difficult time, and we’re not asking you to hurt your bank account, or not pay a bill because of this.  But if you can donate to help get this piece of Heavy Metal history back on the road again, AND get your name engraved inside the “Pantera limo,” well then, it’s a win-win for ALL!Hope you are healthy and safe, and THANK YOU for considering, maybe for donating, but mostly for loving Heavy Metal, and the music Vinnie and Dime left behind!Peace in a celebrated cloud of music...Jose “Metal Ambassador” ManginThanXxx...Edwin Daboub (video)Eddie Veliz (animation)Kyng (music)Sonny Guillen (CFH)Bridog, Jake Lawson & VP’s estate"

Together, we will work to celebrate and preserve Visual Arts Collective as a hub for culture, community and artistic expression for generations to come. VAC has been closed for over 6 months and has been paying the bills with an SBA loan that runs out in October. While VAC plans to reopen as soon as they are safely able to do so, at the moment every show has been cancelled off the VAC schedule until 2021. Shows that do plan to go forward will be able to sell tickets at 30% capacity. This is not a sustainable business model. Current social distance guidelines will impact every aspect of the business and most shows will barely break even.   Project VACscene is raising funds to help VAC slowly reopen and subsidize lost revenues and operating expenses for the next 6 months: November 2020 - May 2021. Monies raised will support monthly operational expenses until Spring of 2021 when hopefully things have improved. For example, it costs $12,000 a month for bare-bones rent and utilities, and while very small gatherings are currently allowed, every event at VAC in 2020 has been cancelled.Your donation will pay for: +  Building Rent +  Utilities +  Ongoing supplies to keep VAC safe and clean (when open)+  Extra security to enforce CoVid social distance requirements (when open)+  Funds to cover staff hourly for shows that do not break even+  CoVid related building upgrades and expenses To help reopen VAC and to keep it open now and the future we need to raise $96,650.00.  You can give in direct and meaningful ways:+ Click the Donate Now button! + Give to the Art Auction on the theme ""Love Letters For VAC"" (happening in December)   + Submit letters to ""Love Letters For VAC"" for an art book available for purchase in Feb 2021! Project VACscene and Love Letters for VAC has the full support of the VAC team.

Think of where they happened. We’re willing to bet that at least one of them happened at a concert. Our industry is based around the idea of bringing people together for shared communal artistic experiences, and our industry is in real trouble. In March of this year the first cancellations came, and what at the time felt like a weekend of lost revenue has now turned in to a year of lost revenue. This has affected musicians, agents, managers, and fans in ways that are profound and direct, though at the center of it all independent venues have been affected in ways that are almost incalculable.Independent venues are rooms that don’t have the backing of a national or international conglomerate. They are owned by people that have a stake in the communities that they seek to serve. They come in all shapes and sizes. From Sun Tiki to The Apohadion to Blue, from SPACE Gallery to One Longfellow Square and all the way up to Port City Music Hall, the State Theatre and Thompson’s Point. We are an ecosystem that cannot operate individually and we understand that together we are stronger than one. Over the last ten years our venues have brought thousands of shows, bands, ideas and unique experiences to our city. Collectively, we are one of the biggest employers in Portland. We generate millions of dollars in both direct and indirect revenue and we brought credibility to a city that was once without much credibility in the touring industry. Bands that had never really thought about playing Portland are now automatically including Portland in their touring plans. Throughout the past several years, the biggest beneficiary of all of this was the fans. Portland has some of the best fans in existence. In turn, our venues always try to treat fans with the respect and dignity that they deserve. Our fans are recognized as the lifeblood that keeps venues, musicians, and the industry as a whole resilient day after day, year after year. Now our venues need you more than ever. If you value our venues as much as we value you, our fans, please donate whatever amount is comfortable for you. All donations will be pooled and distributed to Portland’s music venues based on metrics of need, capacity and operating costs. Any amount helps.We sincerely appreciate all of you."

If these songs are fruit from my life, they're not meant to stay hidden, but to be offered. Lately I've been reminded of people and places across different seasons of my life that have shaped who I am and encouraged this part of what I am created to do. If you're reading this, I bet you're one of them! We didn't build “record an album"" into our year, especially given these recent months, so that's where the risk comes in ;)  We've been working hard and believing hard for the funds needed. I humbly want to ask for your prayers and I invite you to sow into this project financially. Funds will cover tracking, mixing, mastering, and creating a bit of supporting content around the music.The grace we have felt around doing this has been unmistakable. In early June I felt a clear “NOW” that I couldn’t ignore. It's time. This is taking big faith, but that’s part of every story involving a big YES, isn’t it? I can’t fully express how much your support means as this becomes a reality. And with equal joy I can't wait to share this music with you. LOVE,  Kiley"

Every single dime raised will go towards Kevin's musical studies. We (his mother and I) intend on opening up a bank account/trust fund from which he can withdraw the campaign funds on an as need basis. Kevin Belcher is a 16 year old rising junior and budding musician at Maynard Jackson High School in Atlanta, Georgia. Having overcome many obstacles in order to pursue his dream of becoming a prominent and successful musician, his aspirations were finally realized. On June 17th, 2020, Kevin was accepted into the world renowned Interlochen Arts Academy to study classical clarinet! (Learn more about Interlochen here. https://www.interlochen.org/) Kevin has managed to navigate himself through personal adversity and persevere through many obstacles. He has managed to hold strong in his pursuit of his dreams, despite the lack of examples to visualize himself in the spaces he desires, and as a result, the temptation to give up. And although he is blessed to have family, friends, and teachers who uplift and push him; he still requires major financial support in order to fully realize his pursuits to attend Interlochen. His deposit of $1,700.00 is due on July 1st, 2020 with the remainder of his $66,000 tuition ($25,000 after his scholarship) to be paid in the fall of the 2020-2021 school year. All additional funds will go towards next (senior) year's tuition.This is where you come in. Kevin needs to raise $25,000 in order to have the chance to experience, study, and be in the same spaces of talented and like minded student musicians such as himself. He understands that it is not going to be easy. However, he believes, with our support, he will be prepared for the inevitable challenges that lie ahead and will be reinvigorated to put in the work to pursue his dreams and aspirations. I believe I can speak for him and say unequivocally, that Kevin will be eternally grateful for every single contribution toward reaching his goal.Kevin’s final performance is on July 19th, at First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, 1328 Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta 30309 during the 11 am service.  If possible, please support him in his farewell performance to Interlochen by attending and donating to his tuition fund.

As the largest public database of Black talent in film, we look to serve production companies in finding new talent to represent; creative agencies in finding fresh voices to bring their campaigns to life; most of all we are in service of the Black film community, aiming to increase job opportunities, equity, and influence in the creative community. For us, by us. We’ve been featured in publications such as AdAge  and Little Black Book  and have had an overwhelmingly positive response from supporters all over the globe. Our mission is to identify the needs of our community and work with agencies, brands, and production companies to transform the way we approach bidding and hiring. By this point we all know that diversity raises the bottom line and creates more dynamic stories, but how do creative institutions implement ‘diversity’ on an operational level? This is the enigma we are seeking to unpack at Bid Black. Currently, we are working on rolling out new features on our website for the community we serve and we would love your support in helping us do so. Bid Black will begin presenting the work of talent represented on the site in a library format for a curated viewing experience. Also in development is the expansion of the database into other creative roles like composers, production designers, animators and producers.

The freedom that came with it empowered him to access opportunities and a future he’d never dreamed of before. As for many of us, 2020 has made him reconsider where Black people have come from and where they are now. Is there really a difference? Are we all truly free? John has decided to embark on a journey of endurance and determination as a medium to process this struggle. At 25 years old, the age many black men meet their demise, the New York City bike messenger will cycle 1,114 miles along the Underground Railroad, a life and death trek for those who attempted it in the early to mid-1800s.This is adventure cycling, a discipline marked by a vast underrepresentation of POC. This is a story of activism, adventure and deep connection to the ancestors along the way. This is a ride of protest, resistance, and hope. The film documenting his passage is our call to action to act as both witnesses to history while also active participants.

James is known as a musician, saxophonist, singer, songwriter, and one of the leaders of the Funk / /Punk  / Jazz / No Wave movements that began in the late 1970s in downtown New York City, with his groundbreaking groups The Contortions and James White and the Blacks.

James and Judy currently live in New York and have both been severely affected by personal health issues and the COVID situation. James had to cut short his European tour last year due to a sudden health crisis, and Judy suffers from a long term debilitating illness that keeps her confined to home. The family has hopes that James will recover, however there is scarce employment for musicians during this time of pandemic.

In October of last year, James' father Donald Siegfried who had been James' lifeline of support during his health crisis, died rather suddenly, and his mother, Jean Siegfried, had to be relocated to a memory care facility, leaving little in the way of family funds to continue support to James and Judy.

Any donations you are able to give at this time will be going directly to cover the cost of James and Judy's medical and living expenses, and any funds beyond their immediate needs will go into a retirement fund for James.

Right now, I am in need of a new concert grand harp.I've been playing the harp for 12 years- receiving my Bachelor's degree from Wayne State University in 2014 for Harp performance. I have also performed alongside artists such as Kelela, Juliana Huxtable, Tunde Olaniran and Kelsey Lu.   Receiving an electro-acoustic harp will allow me to play both acoustically, as well allow me to play easily with amplifications, a quality sound for recording sessions, add electronic effects,  perform in larger rooms, and create innovative on-stage soundscapes . In order to decide on a harp, I also must travel to harp showrooms and try them out before buying. I will need to travel from Virginia, New Jersey, and Chicago to test multiple harps out. I am looking to make my goal as soon as possible to finish my début Electronic R&B EP, and to enhance my live performances and collaborations. It would really mean a lot to me to know you support and believe in my art to help me continue exploring the harp outside of classical music. If you help me reach my goal, I will give a free 30 min virtual concert on my new instrument at a later date! See price breakdowns and check out some of my work below.

Creative,2020 Black Voter Engagement Video Project,"Brooklyn, NY",27705.0,65000.0,97,204,2K,"The turnout of Black voters will be a deciding, if not the deciding, factor in the upcoming presidential election. That's why we at Emerald Media are seeking funding to produce a Black voter engagement video project to be released across digital platforms in the lead up to the 2020 presidential election. The project will comprise a series of short videos, set against the backdrop of the election and the pandemic, profiling Black people living in cities with significant Black populations. The project is the first part of a series we are developing to amplify Black voices in the American political story. Our goal is to increase Black voter engagement as a method of empowerment for Black people and communities. In an election where door knocking will be severely limited due to the pandemic, we know that storytelling will be an even more important tool than usual to reach voters. When Black voters, as is the case with all voters,  recognize themselves in the narrative of the election, they will vote. Emerald Media is uniquely qualified to undertake such a project.  We are campaign professionals, organizers, researchers, and filmmakers, committed to building a more equitable and inclusive world. From education in underserved communities to criminal justice reform to political candidacies, we have captured a number of subjects and issues related to the Black experience in America.For samples of our video work, please click here.The funds will be used for production and distribution, which includes:1) Production fees, including the hiring of crews2) Equipment rental3)Transportation and lodging for production staff4) EditingWith less than 3 weeks to go in the most consequential election of our lifetime, please consider a contribution so we can do this essential work.Thank you!Jordan, Sophia, Chris & the Whole Team at the Emerald Media"
Creative,Legacy: A Black Queer Production Collective,"Brooklyn, NY",27271.0,100000.0,131,560,183,"Legacy: A Black Queer Production CollectiveOur Mission: We are a group of Black, queer artists based in New York. We collectivized in response to the deep-seated and ongoing underappreciation, undervaluing, and underfunding of Black queer art. We focus on uplifting Black LGBTQIA+ voices and experiences by: creating space for artistic endeavors, compensating fairly for time and work, and fostering fellowship and opportunity for our communities, present and future. The conversation on the seat at the table owed to Black people in media and the arts has reached a peak pitch in recent times. As Black queer artists, we dedicate ourselves to creating artistically striking works that shift culture and offer largely excluded perspectives. In the past, like so many of our peers, we've had to accomplish our creative visions with little to no resources, often relying on ambition and drive to push our projects forward.Despite our financial limitations, we've accomplished a great deal with our craft both collectively and individually. In this time of global pandemic, we are not being paid to make art. For the most part, we are not getting paid at all. At this time, we are looking toward those who enjoy and benefit from our art to also invest in our future. To execute this vision, we are asking for more than a seat at the table.Instead, we intend to build our own table. Thus, we are launching a production company that will focus on providing resources to artists and creatives most often underrepresented in media. Our community has contributed to mainstream culture for far too long without compensation, and we are ready to enact change.In order to launch this production company, we have set a goal to raise $100k. This money will go to paying artists for their time and talents, securing tech (costuming, cinematography, makeup artists, choreographers, editors, etc), renting spaces, and producing fully realized visions. We have projects in the works spanning music, performance art, screenwriting, theatre, dance, and more.  Any donation, big or small, can make a huge difference in helping us achieve our goals while doing what we love most.  Thank you so much for your time and support. Peace&Love,Legacy*founding members: Basit, Garrett, Kyle, Ashton"

Our small town high school show choir is a point of pride for the Findlay community, and FFE has made a name for itself across the United States for excellence in show and character. First Edition teaches you teamwork, self discipline, and empathy. If you know anything about the late nights, tap rehearsals, summer camp meltdowns, or have been to a Cabaret show, you understand that FFE is more than an extracurricular activity. It breeds passionate, hardworking artists.On an average year, the target budget for FFE is somewhere around $80,000. That's right-- dresses, competition fees, our choreographer Andy, travel expenses: it's all paid for by fundraising. With the loss of both of major fundraisers in 2020, the group stands to miss out on a year of performing, traveling, or even rehearsing with any degree of normalcy.We’d be remiss not to point out that everyone is struggling this year; everywhere you turn, there is another fundraiser for something equally (if not more) important than singing and dancing in a sequin dress and tap shoes. But we’ve been in those shoes, and the show must go on. The FFE alumni have taken it upon themselves to raise $50,000 to pledge in donation to Findlay First Edition, and we need the help of the Findlay community and beyond to get us to our goal.Whatever you can give, big or small, know that you’re providing support and opportunity to a group of dynamic, hardworking singers, dancers, crew members, and musicians. This is what it truly means to “Go With a Song in Your Heart.”Much love and many thanks,The FFE Alumni Network"

These last few months have been challenging for us all but we are determined to bring quality entertainment back to the Roaring Fork Valley for years to come. But to do that, we need your help. In order for us to open, the regulations state that we can only have 25% of our capacity and reduced cast size for the foreseeable future. But this leaves us with a very tight margin to succeed. We want to keep our prices as low as possible, so everyone who has been impacted by the recent closures, might still be able to afford a night out for some much needed laughter. So we are asking our community and fans all over the country and world for a bit of help. On Thursday, July 9th, we will be having our first ever Live and Virtual Fundraiser. This show will be our all New Live Summer Show but it will also be live streamed out to the world for everyone to see free of charge. During the performance, we will be connecting with those who join us online and giving shout outs to those who donate online. We also have several amazing guest artists who will be joining us remotely or via previously recorded performances!And we will be developing our ""The Show Must Go On Wall of Fame"" and everyone who donates now or in the future, will get a Vaudeville Boater Hat with your name and donation amount mounted on our wall for all time. The audience for this show will be invited guests only but we hope that all of our fans and customers will watch on line and through laughter be motivated to help us through this challenging time. The details of how this will be live streamed will be announced on our website and social media very soon.All the money raised will go directly and immediately to The Glenwood Vaudeville Revue to help pay our performers and staff as well as help pay bills that added up during the shut down as well as help keep us afloat in the days ahead when we can only do 2 shows a week to only 25% of our usual audience. Thank you so much for all of your support! Together we will keep live theatre happening in the Roaring Fork Valley for years to come! Sincerely, John GossOwner & Director of the Glenwood Vaudeville Revue"
Creative,Black Opera at Portland Protests,"Portland, OR",25066.0,30000.0,173,473,2.1K,"My name is Emmanuel Henreid, and I’m a singer and a professional musician. I am raising money for ""Livin' in the Light"", a short film and musical EP. The film documents my experience of singing in Portland during quarantine and at protests as one of the only Black male professional opera singers in the Pacific Northwest working in modern/crossover genres. COVID-19 canceled all of my singing events with Portland Opera and multiple other local opera companies, as well as all other bookings at events around town. All of our amphitheaters and venues are closed. Given that I live in a small space with roommates, I have nowhere to practice. My voice is an instrument. If I don't use it, I risk losing it. To be able to practice, I have resorted to singing in the streets. I also sing at Black Lives Matter and civil rights protests. In the last two months, I’ve been stopped by building security guards on numerous occasions and have had the cops called on me just for singing. Knowing that 1 in 1000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, I am quite literally risking my life to preserve my instrument and practice my art. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that African Americans account for 33 percent of COVID hospitalizations, largely because Black people have high rates of chronic health conditions—called comorbidities—that weaken the immune system and make them more vulnerable to the virus. But much less discussed is how food, class, and race have intersected in ways that perpetuate the health disparities and social inequities unfolding today. By losing access to income from events and ticket sales, I’ve encountered even greater risk — both physical and economic — in the face of the pandemic.  The film will be directed by me and produced by non-profit queer creative studio Future Prairie, lead by Portland Parks and Recreation creative-in-residence Joni Renee Whitworth. Future Prairie is raising money through a variety of sources, including grants from foundations and larger non-profits, this campaign, individual donors, and virtual fundraising events. We're raising $15,000 for the documentary, $10,000 for the EP of music, and $5,000 for the music video that will accompany both pieces. Livin' in the Light is a bold, timely message to creatives, urging them to keep making and sharing art during the pandemic and challenging institutional responses to this crisis. My film and music document the impact of COVID-19 on Black creatives. This work is an attempt to witness and index the joy, perseverance, and struggle of being a Black male artist in what is often called ""the Whitest City in America"" while honoring the timeless art form that is opera."

I am a photographer/activist (based in Atlanta) that is currently traveling the country, documenting the Black Lives Matter movement and protests. After spending countless weeks on the road, I realized that I had accumulated enough content to publish a photo book that could document the movement from the perspective of those of us that were on the ground.Many times, the news provides an account of events that doesn’t fully communicate the context and/or nuances of the events being reported. My goal is to provide an account from the perspective of the protestors and activists as we saw it.All funds from this campaign will go toward the costs of production (Approximately $8,000), as well as travel expenses for additional content needed to complete the book.

Creative,'Lochen it In!,"Jonesboro, GA",24755.0,30000.0,141,235,968,"Greetings, I had the pleasure of speaking with rising senior and accomplished bass trombonist, Rodney Rhodes Jr. out of Avon High School in Avon, Indiana. I do not know Rodney personally, but his story has captivated me. He is a self taught bass trombonist who’s been playing for 2.5 years. In that short amount of time, he has participated in the Honor Orchestra of America, Indiana All-State, Indianapolis Youth Orchestra, and Indianapolis Side-by-Side. On June 30, 2020, he was selected to continue his studies at the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy (IAA) in Michigan. (Find out more about Interlochen here https://www.interlochen.org/) Rodney was awarded $55,000 in scholarship funds, however he still needs assistance in reaching the $75,000 for tuition. Additionally, he will need assistance in obtaining a MacBook, as it is a requirement for all students at IAA. I am reaching out to the village on behalf of Rodney to raise the remaining $25,000 to attend IAA. $2000 of that total was due for a deposit to enroll yesterday, July 7th. Luckily, he has been granted an extension. Demonstrated by his sheer tenacity, Rodney has proven that he is more than capable of doing hard work. While his dad is a truck driver and his mom an in-home caretaker for the elderly, Rodney currently works 8-9 hour shifts at Papa Johns in order to contribute to his own tuition fund for IAA. The instrument he currently plays was acquired through his fundraising. He practices many hours a day. Did I mention he’s self taught? We can not let his hard work and determination be for naught. Will you help me send this deserving young man to Interlochen? #interlochenbound"

Creative,AMERICA: A Not-for-Profit Film by David Soul,"Chico, CA",26000.0,25000.0,73,131,695,"Dear Friend (perks below, in case you didn’t notice they’re there),I’m David Soul (that actor from Starsky and Hutch).This has been, without a doubt, a year of upheaval for everyone. Values, health, beliefs, finances, security, freedoms … EVERYTHING we’ve known has been challenged and tested … turned on its head. Now, one imperative stands out. If we are going to survive as a Democracy, if we are going to stick together as a nation, the next few years will be the most critical ones we’ve ever faced. I’m not talking about political preferences. I’m talking about our future, the very HEART and SOUL of America … what we say we—as a ‘people’—believe.Still…When a deadly virus can take nearly 200,000 lives in the U.S. while some scoff at scientific data and medical advice, at the same time claiming that the government, or some crazy conspiracy, is trying to take away their ‘freedoms’ by demanding that masks be worn and social distancing be adhered to … with no thought for their fellow citizens …When people of color, believing what AMERICA promises, hunger for the equality and justice guaranteed to them as citizens by the Constitution, are denied access to what their fellow white Americans have enjoyed for more than 250 years… When a society, torn by systemic racism and preferential treatment, turns on those whose skin color or lack of money or status, leads to brutality delivered by the very police officers sworn to ʻserve and protect,’ and when that brutality exacerbates the violence that then gives rise to intimidation, death, and destruction, and eventually the involvement of anarchists bent on their own cause…Well, then…It’s time to back off, regroup, and take a good hard look at who we are as a people and as a country … both the good and the bad. These remarkable events have given impetus to a short documentary film that follows the best and the worst of WHO we are as a people and a nation, from our inception in the early 17th century up to and including 2020 and beyond. Who are we? Who do we say we want to be? What have we become? … and, finally, what can we be again if we STICK TOGETHER?Underpinning this message is a song I recorded forty years ago, called AMERICA, written by my friend, Jack Murphy. I loved the song, but it didn’t really fit with the selection of songs I was putting together for an album called THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE. Ironic, you might say. In any case, I put AMERICA on the shelf where it’s been sitting for the past four decades, patiently waiting for the right moment. Well, the time has come. The message of the film is urgently needed, perhaps more than ever. ‘WE THE PEOPLE,’ even as we resolved back in 1776, need to stick together to make America a better place for all.This not-for-profit short film documentary will be available to EVERYONE for free online and on all platforms. But, at the moment, the challenge for the producers is that archival video footage, and past and present pictorial images from the various photo agencies that we need to work with to tell the story of AMERICA, are rather expensive. So, we are appealing to you to help us make this short film a reality. Will you help us, please?I honestly don’t like asking for money, but in this case, we are in need of around $25,000 to complete the film. I do believe you will find it thought-provoking and thoroughly worthwhile. Please give what you can, and for your generous gifts, there will be gifts for you, too.On behalf of AMERICA, I thank you in advance.David SoulDONATION PERKSYou will be a player in the production of this documentary—and in ‘changing the world’ (at least the world within the United States).$25-$49 (USD)An Autographed GOLD CD and On-Site Supporter CreditAs a contributor in this amount range, you’ll receive an autographed GOLD CD, as well as have your name featured as a Supporter on the AMERICA webpage. $50-$99 (USD)A Personalized Autographed GOLD CD and On-Site Supporter CreditAs a contributor in this amount range, you’ll receive a personalized autographed GOLD CD, as well as have your name featured as a Supporter on the AMERICA webpage.$100-$249 (USD)Personalized Autographed AMERICA Postcard and On-Site Contributor CreditA limited edition autographed POSTCARD of an American Bald Eagle drawn exclusively by David Soul, and personalized to you, as well.

Creative,Keep Jax Live,"Jacksonville, FL",22636.0,22000.0,204,342,3.7K,"From Tim Hall: SOME HISTORY:  I don't know how many shows I've booked or tickets I've sold. It's only in the last two months that I've really thought about my past shows at length. Just under 23 years ago I booked my first show in North Florida: a sellout with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy at Fat Kat Music Hall. A year later Anne, my wife, opened Jack Rabbits with Big Sky as our first show. (They sold us out too!) When asked about my favorite shows, I always talk about what's to come. But, like so many, the concert world is at a standstill. Plans to ""reopen the country"" list concerts and theaters in the last stages and that’s with a reduced capacity. But we know that music is as much a part of life as breathing is to so many people. Shows WILL happen! We just need to make it through this transition. OUR CURRENT REALITY:  So far we haven’t qualified for any of the government “small business” programs or even been approved for unemployment. We’ve made it through lean times before. When the touring industry was devastated for over a year after 9/11, we held in there. That’s why Jack Rabbits is one of the oldest venues of its size in the southeast. But our reserves are running out. We’re going to need help to keep JaxLive and Jack Rabbits alive. We've started a GoFundMe with a goal of $22,000:  $1,000 for each of our 22 years of shows. In addition to our operating costs, the shutdown interrupted a loan application that we’d started to pay for, among other things, a new shed for our walkin cooler. Though “the other things” can wait, a new shed cannot. We also need to make changes to Jack Rabbits to follow new safety guidelines in light of Covid-19. Again, that takes money. HOW TO HELP:  If you can help, Anne and I thank you. Lisa, Rob, Lee and the rest of the extended family at Jack Rabbits and JaxLive thank you. Times past we’ve been able to help others out. But there’s also been times that we couldn't because we just didn’t have it to spare. So please don’t worry if you can’t donate today. We know we're not the only ones struggling right now. Just save up so that you can come out to hear that new band you like the next time they're in town. That's helping too! Please let your friends & family know about our campaign via your Instagram, Facebook and/or Twitter with the hashtag #KeepJaxLive. OUR THANKS:  As a token of our appreciation, donors that contribute $100 will receive a complimentary ticket to any Jack Rabbits show and two drink tickets.  Donors that contribute $500 will receive a pair of tickets to a Jack Rabbits show and a $100 bar-tab at Jack Rabbits. Please note that, as always, complimentary tickets are subject to venue capacity. So if a show is sold-out, then the complimentary ticket can not be redeemed for that show. Cheers to another 22 years -- hopefully. **Did you do THIS Show? I’ve produced and booked a lot of shows and not only at Jack Rabbits. We've made a limited and partial list* here .  If you're wondering if a show is one of mine, then email JaxLiveMusic with band name(s), the venue and the year. Thanks to storm damage at both our home and Jack Rabbits there are big gaps in our written records before 2010. With a name and a year or venue then I can verify that it was my show. But after tens of thousands of shows over thirty plus years, clues really help! From 1987 to 1999 I did thousands of shows in Southern California including Pearl Jam, Blur, Korn, Kid Rock and Tool. From 1998 to present, I've done shows in Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Tallahassee. With rare exception, all the shows at Jack Rabbits and Freebird Live were mine. In addition, I've produced shows at over 20 other venues including St. Augustine Amphitheatre, Florida Theatre and 1904 Music Hall."

With this body of work I wanted to go back to the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968); when African Americans were fighting for constitutional and legal rights that other Americans already had at the time. I particularly referenced protest signs from this era to spark a discussion of why they’re still relevant more than 50 years later. I want to show that far too often we look back at that time as if it was centuries ago, when in fact it’s a fight that’s ongoing.Adeshola Makinde  is an artist based in Chicago, Illinois. He was raised in the Chicagoland suburbs. He got his start taking photos at parties, concerts, fashion shows and other cultural events.

Creative,North County Dance Arts Needs Our Support,"San Diego, CA",22135.0,888888.0,138,96,99,"Award Winning North County Dance Arts (NCDA), (www.northcountydancearts.com) in San  Diego, CA needs our support now.  Read on.  This year is NCDA’s celebration of 40 Years of Dance.  “Reflections” is the theme for the 2020 virtual recital.  As we “reflect” on the history of NCDA and the rich story of its founders Louis and Tanya McKay, we share a glimpse into these 2 remarkable individuals who have shaped not only a community of dancers but a community of family like none other.  Louis McKay is a beloved husband, father, grandfather, dancer, singer, choreographer, teacher, and philanthropist.  His talents landed him on Broadway in the production of Annie Get Your Gun.  He was lead singer and dancer as well as choreographer for The Debbie Reynolds Show for 7 years and has performed in other iconic shows including Sandy Duncan, Liberace, Bob Hope, Johnny Carson, Sonny and Cher, Barbara Mandrel and the list goes on.  He is the recipient of 2 People’s Choice Awards and other accolades too numerous to mention.  Tanya McKay is a beautiful wife, mother, grandmother, dancer, choreographer, teacher and philanthropist.  She is a classically trained ballerina and a student of jazz having been a featured dancer in various video presentations produced for industrial use and television. Tanya has also appeared in print work including the cover of San Diego’s North County Pages and featured in several San Diego Union lifestyle and fitness articles.   NCDA is more than just a dance studio.  It is the culmination of the McKay’s passion and is representative of their life’s work having advanced so many students over the years, some of whom (like the authors writing this) never leave because we love them and what the studio brings to our lives so much.  NCDA is a place for children and adults of all abilities from first steps to professional performers to accomplish their personal best and develop strong self-esteem in warm, welcoming  and nurturing environment.  For many of the students, the studio is a home away from home where hugs are abundant and given freely, creativity and self-expression are encouraged, lifelong friendships are formed, acceptance is a given and personal achievements and self-growth realized.  From these authors’ perspective and we are sure other students’ as well, standing in a tap line with Louis McKay in his signature red tap shoes, hands on hips, sass oozing is an experience like no other and is one of many that has captured all of our hearts.  Their commitment to their students is unwavering  and resolute.  But wait - there’s so much more to share about the McKays.  In 2001, Louis and Tanya established Dance Hearts, a 501 (c) 3 public charity known as Bells of Freedom (www.bellsoffreedom.org) supporting our US military men and women and their families throughout the year.  100% of the funds raised go to the charity.  Louis and Tanya take nothing for themselves, not even to cover overhead costs and other expenses.  They work tirelessly at connecting in-service military men and women to the community they serve in the form of holiday “family” adoptions, emergency support and the development of transitional housing for the many women and children displaced due to adverse situation such that they can no longer remain in military housing.  Each year, they serve over 100 military families which accounts for assisting approximately 800 military men, women and children.We have all witnessed and been affected by the adverse impact on small businesses from COVID-19 over the last many months.  Despite being shut down with minimal ability to generate income, business expenses have and continue to accumulate.  The good news is, these uncertain times give us the opportunity to band together and give back to 2 very special people who have touched the lives of so many and who give so generously of themselves every single day.  Louis and Tanya are real life Angels. They are OUR FAMILY and they need us.  While every measure is being taken to make the 2020 virtual recital a reality, the current circumstances around COVID continue to create uncertainty.  That said, SHOW MUST AND WILL GO ON!  However, current restrictions and the looming possibility of potential future shutdowns mean no one has been working at capacity and may not be for quite some time.  So, if you are in a position to support NCDA we will be extremely grateful to receive your financial help.  If you could let others know about this campaign who may also be in a position to contribute, that too is greatly appreciated.Thank you in advance to all of you who have taken the time to read this and for your donations.See you on the dance floor and as Louis says at the end of every class when we take a bow; “Ladies, Gentlemen, We Love Ya Baby! God Bless.”"

The astronomical cost of living in the Bay Area combined with an annual tuition of over $50,000 make it nearly insurmountable for many to attend, let alone thrive, at CCA.  'CCA's student body is 14% Asian American, 13% Hispanic/Latinx, and 4% African American' —an unacceptable disconnect between higher education and the BIPOC artist community in the Bay Area.During this time of COVID and a global Black Lives Matter Civil Rights movement, these students are particularly vulnerable. With your help, we can remove some of the hurdles they face in meeting their living expenses and buying art supplies.All proceeds will go toward unrestricted grants to working-class and BIPOC students to meet their most pressing needs to remain in school. Our goal is to provide a grant to every qualified student that applies.The arts have always been closely intertwined with social change and are vital for community engagement through sharing information, envisioning a peaceful and just society, and most importantly, humanizing voices and fears that are often unheard. Creativity takes courage and courage takes community.

Creative,An art space for QBIPOC creatives in MPLS,"Minneapolis, MN",21906.0,20000.0,120,469,420,"
My name is Vanessa McDuffie—I’m a special education teacher, a writer, local creative and a community advocate from Minneapolis. As a dark skinned queer femme womxn living in the Midwest, I’ve had to carve out my own representation along my journey to self acceptance.  It hasn’t been easy, but my community has looked out for me in ways that I will forever be grateful for.Representation has come a long way since the time I was searching for it in so many white spaces..

But it needs to go further...I’m ready to carve out another piece of it. Not for me, but for the queer folx coming up behind.

NUE BEDFORD is an art gallery DEVOTED to uplifting the QUEER BIPOC voices of Minneapolis. The idea is to have a unified space to house local art of the queer community in a safe, loving, supportive environment. It’s this generation’s job to continue the goal of visibility for our queer siblings so they can see themselves sooner than we did.

This is a dream I’ve had my entire life. My existence is devoted to the art world and community service of Minnesota, and I intend to do my part to highlight the queer BIPOC artists who want space to express and my the world brighter. 

Community & allies: please help make this big  dream become a reality. 

We need a space!! Help us make it possible to rent a space to (eventually!) create workshops, pop up shops, gallery events and networking opportunities for an inclusive Minneapolis art scene. As of now, funds will go to the following:-space to rent-website and logo-marketing budget -events budget 

We’re starting slow—we need a space, but it won’t be physically     available to the public until the end of the year (due to Covid). But there’s plenty of work to do before then.

Creative,Save IAF!,"North Hollywood, CA",21294.0,155000.0,103,181,112,"*See donation tier breakdown below

Dear friends, IAF family and dance communityIt is with a heavy heart but one full of hope that I write this message. Like so many small studio owners, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unforeseen challenges, new obstacles, and has forced us to temporarily shut our doors. Today, with Los Angeles being one of the hardest hit areas and the pandemic still raging on, it pains me to announce that this has led to the closure of our IAF Compound.MY STORY:When I first moved to Los Angeles eight years ago to compete on So You Think You Can Dance, I was inspired not only by the talent that is attracted to LA, but also the diverse and supportive dance community that I was becoming a part of. Knowing that not all dancers could afford private academies, I created IAF with the intention of helping young dancers find their passion and to help older dancers forge their unique talents into artistry. Two years ago, I opened the IAF Compound in North Hollywood to provide a safe and welcoming space for dancers to explore their own creativity, refine their technique, and collaborate with one another. It has been a journey filled with so much love and passion that I have poured just as much of my heart and soul into IAF as you all have.COVID IMPACT:Before COVID-19 hit, I decided to invest in a new state of the art sprung flooring system by Harlequin Floors. For me, this immense financial undertaking was an important step towards being a responsible studio owner. Unfortunately, it has added to the mounting financial burdens this pandemic has brought on.As a result I have no choice but to let go of the current space. While the IAF Compound will be officially closing its doors in September, I am doing everything in my power to keep my vision for this brand alive. In a last effort to save IAF, I decided to downsize to a smaller, more affordable space for the time being, in hopes that we can continue providing the dance community with classes and programs. THE ASK:I am turning to the most extraordinary people I know. You who inspire me. You who collaborate with me. You who grow with me. And you who make this all possible. In launching this campaign, I am hoping to not only recuperate from the financial losses IAF has experienced, but to open our doors even wider for our dance community to recover in the months to come. My hope is that this campaign will allow us to continue to create, educate and inspire! Despite the uncertainty of the future, the IAF Team has remained committed to our mission of providing high-quality dance training and a creative outlet. We are continuing to develop new ways of reaching our dancers through our online platform, IAF Prime. With our new, downsized location, we will be able to film and produce content for dancers. It will also provide dancers with a space to return to their craft once the pandemic has passed. The future of the IAF is at stake, but I have faith that with your support, we will be able to see this through. Any donation, no matter the amount, would be greatly and sincerely appreciated. Every single donation will get us one step closer to opening our doors.OUR GOAL:Our goal is to raise $155,000.This number largely reflects our operational costs and monetary loss as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, it reflects the funds needed to support our promise to the dance community:IAF PLEDGE:If we reach our goal of raising $155,000,  IAF pledges to be the first LA dance studio to offer free dance training for all  dancers who donate to our cause.**See donation tier breakdown belowOur mission is to use this campaign as a means to support dancers that can’t afford classes and quality training due to months of being out of work. As we receive your support, we feel it is imperative to do our part in giving back and helping the dance community get back on its feet.I want to thank everyone who has stood by IAF during these difficult times. I will continue to work tirelessly on maintaining IAF as a stronghold for creativity and artistry within the dance community. Your support means the world to me and I hope that I can continue to pay it forward.With the utmost gratitude,Chehon Wespi-TschoppEXPENSE BREAKDOWN:LOSS: $73,253 (INCLUDES RENT, UTILITIES, STAFF AND TEACHER PAY DURING 5 MONTHS OF SHUT DOWN)MONTHLY EXPENSES: $18,700 / MONTH (INCLUDES RENT, UTILITIES, STAFF AND TEACHER PAY)DONATION BREAKDOWN: *Complimentary class cards include IAF OPEN MASTER CLASSES*All classes, including IAF OPEN MASTER CLASSES, are redeemable through December 31, 2021Up to $99 Donation:IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: Complimentary 1 month class card$100 Donation: GUARANTEED: Complimentary 1 month class card (Up to 12 free classes)IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:  Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)$300 Donation: GUARANTEED: Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)$500 Donation:GUARANTEED:- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration for all IAF Master classes- Redeemable until December 2021IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET: - Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Priority registration for all IAF Master classes- Redeemable until December 2021$1,000 Donation: GUARANTEED:- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF  CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021IF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021$2,500 Donation: GUARANTEED:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- One VIP ticket to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 seasonIF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS-Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)-Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021-One VIP ticket to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season$5,000 Donation:GUARANTEED:- NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE- FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 2 month class card (Up to 24 free classes)- Redeemable until December 2021- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- Two VIP tickets to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season- Private studio tour with IAF Director Chehon prior to re-openingIF WE REACH OUR GOAL, YOU GET:-NAME ADDED TO OUR DONOR RECOGNITION WALL, DISPLAYED IN OUR NEW STUDIO SPACE-FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO DONATE AT THIS TIER WILL RECEIVE PRIVATE MASTER CLASS WITH ONE OF OUR IAF CHOREOGRAPHERS- Complimentary 3 month class card (Up to 36 free classes)- Redeemable until December 2021- Priority registration in all IAF master classes- Redeemable until December 2021- Two VIP tickets to any IAF performance or showcase for the 2020/2021 season- Private studio tour with IAF Director Chehon prior to re-openingIf you wish to donate above our listed donation tiers, please reach out to us at admin @ iamforce . com  to receive information on our elite donor packages."
Creative,Save Our Theatre,"Corpus Christi, TX",21268.0,50000.0,91,273,2.7K,"The year began with such promise — our 10th Anniversary celebration! What was to be a season filled with rejoicing, would quickly turn into our biggest struggle. The year promised to be one of celebration where friends old & new would rejoice in the plays, actors, and community events that have made the Aurora Arts Theatre what it is today. Eddie Chapa realized his dream of establishing a theatre in 2010, but sadly, he was only able to see its success for one short year, as he passed away in February of 2011. While that was a devastating day for all of us, I found comfort in knowing the happiness that the theatre brought to his life. While I felt the overwhelming love of Eddie’s family and my own, I soon realized I had yet another family I could turn to — my theatre family. They rallied around me, and the theatre soon became my refuge. With the tremendous encouragement and support I received from the community, I realized that the theatre had not only been my refuge, but also the refuge for many who also found solace, cheer, and a sense of belonging at the Aurora.The Aurora has been fortunate to be a part of such a great community for the past 10 years. When we produce a play or a musical, we instantly become a part of something much bigger than the production itself. We renew and create friendships, share ideas, comfort those in need, and share a burst of laughter that just seems to make our day. Whether it be watching or participating in a play, volunteering, or simply having conversations across the concession counter with our great volunteers, the Aurora certainly satisfies a need. The theatre has a unique way of providing a safe space for all and helping those who enter feel right at home. We are always honored and privileged when you, our community, include us in your special moments such as weddings, baptismal celebrations, birthdays, graduations, etc. We look forward to being able to share those celebrations and experiences once again. But now, the Aurora Arts Theatre is in danger of closing its doors forever. The pandemic has affected us all, and while we continue with different activities such as curbside popcorn, cinema nights, t-shirt sales, etc. to bring in revenue, it is just not enough. While these activities do help, they are not sufficient to cover the mounting expenses each month. We know that many find themselves in the same plight as we navigate our emotional struggles and financial constraints, and we are uncertain about what the future holds. The Aurora also faces seemingly insurmountable struggles as restrictions placed on venues such as the Aurora have resulted in significant financial loss. We are humbled by friends that have already contributed to the theatre — you fill our hearts. Now, the Aurora Arts Theatre humbly asks family, friends, and community to help us get through this terrible time. Please know that any contribution is greatly appreciated and will be used to help keep our doors open as we look forward to the day when we can once again call “places” and experience the wonder of live theatre."

Event,Help with post-exoneration expenses!,"Ann Arbor, MI",35846.0,36000.0,213,684,562,"Kevin Harrington was exonerated and released from prison on Tuesday,  April 21st after being incarcerated for 17 years--since he was a 20 year old college student--for a crime that he did not commit. Exonerees confront numerous challenges as they adjust to the world and their freedom under normal circumstances. Covid-19, however, presents a unique set of obstacles. Kevin must self-isolate for two weeks in a hotel before reuniting with his family. The generosity of Michigan Law students has ensured that he will have meals delivered for the entirety of his quarantine. Once that is over, Kevin will need to obtain basic life necessities -- beginning with a place to live and a means of transportation. Kevin will likely be entitled to some form of civil compensation, but that is a long and grueling process that can take months or even years. Your support will mean that Kevin can hit the ground running with the resources he needs for his life as an exonerated man. We have had the privilege of working as Kevin's student attorneys this past year with the Michigan Innocence Clinic. The first time he spoke with us, he told us that he knew that ""this was the year he would walk out of prison.""  Kevin’s relentless optimism never wavered. Kevin wrote a brief in his own defense and helped other inmates with their legal proceedings while incarcerated.  Now that he's free, he hopes to create a more equitable criminal justice system and work on behalf of the wrongfully incarcerated.You can learn more about Kevin's story here: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/exonerated-man-freed-prison-now-hotel-quarantine-i-could-watch-n1192326"

He was his mother’s rock, his brother’s best friend, and loved more than anything in the world being a father to his one year old son, Rowan. While Mike left the Earth too soon, he will always be remembered for his one-of-a-kind, selfless, larger than life personality.

Event,MOMS UNITED FOR BLACK LIVES (PDX & NYC to DC),"Portland, OR",26903.0,25000.0,112,716,1.7K,"The world is in the midst of quite possibly the largest civil rights movement in US history . And Portland, Oregon & NYC have been in the national spotlight  for the last several weeks as examples of the brutal, disproportionate response from the local, state and federal government toward the civil rights protestors of the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, Moms United for Black Lives both Portland and New York City chapters are looking to take that tenacity to Washington DC to advocate for their communities and build solidarity on behalf of their cities during the upcoming August 28th March on DC. New York took note of the hardship faced by the Black community in Portland, because that struggle is not unlike the struggle in NYC. Now, these two cities are joining together in solidarity to amplify one another's work. This bicoastal team of activists and organizers will be uniting for the March on Washington DC on the 57th anniversary of  Martin Luther King’s march on our nation’s capital.  These activists are leaders in their communities; they deserve the opportunity to exercise their rights and speak truth to power in Washington DC. Let's help them get there. Money will be used for:-Roundtrip airfare from PDX & NYC to DC (expensive this close to the date)-Rental cars-Lodging accommodations -Appropriate PPE -Food Extra funds will be shared in mutual aid for community to assist with:  -Hospital expenses-Legal expenses-Housing costs-Food-TransportationOregon has a long history of white supremacy and racism . It was illegal to be Black in the state until 1926 , less than 100 years ago. This racist history permeates everything from public policy to policing. It also greatly informed how the city of Portland came to be “the whitest city in America ” a moniker that still applies today. Daily life as a Black American living in Portland & NYC is –in itself– an act of resistance. According to the most recent census , Oregon’s population is nearly 87% white with only 2.2% being Black or African American and Portland  is 77% white with a 5.8% Black or African American population. So it’s no surprise that the white majority has maintained the below status quo treatment of Black residents and that the Black Lives Matter movement here has been met with such a violent response from elected officials. The ongoing fight for racial justice in Portland & NYC is the fight for racial justice everywhere. These activists are ready to further amplify the voices of their community to a national audience at the march on DC. Please donate today to help these Black revolutionaries take this fight for Black Lives straight to DC’s doorstep. Your support is critical to amplifying the ongoing work and voices of these Black activists who have been doing this work their entire lives. It’s also crucial to sustaining the pressure for systemic change and momentum for Black Lives Matter. No justice. No peace."
Event,BLACK OUT at the CHOP,"Seattle, WA",25493.0,12000.0,162,613,1.4K,"Hi all,Yesterday on Juneteenth, we held a glorious 12 hr celebration of our ancestors and our freedom.  Despite gofundme hindering our access to these funds for whatever reasons. We still managed to cover the following expenses from yesterday's event. - Facilitators who were paid 300 each and will be retroactively paid additional funds when we are given access. - Caterers, who provided individually packaged meals for lunch and dinner with various options to accommodate dietary restrictions. -  A DJ, Pa system, speakers, and a generator for the duration of the event plus one tech person to man the PA all day and attend to any issues as they came up. - All manner of supplies that weren't donated, such as art supplies tables, chairs, ect. - Y-WE trained affinity leaders who led volunteers and facilitated a virtual de-escalation training for all non-black allies that were on the ground as support all day.- Candles, blankets, and other trinkets for both the ancestor's altar and the releasing altar made available to participants during the grief circle. - A black film team to allow our participants to individually share their stories of black healing and liberation. *We are happy to report that we fully supported/paid all-black facilitators and businesses for all of our event needs and staff. We are so grateful to the organizations and people who supported us with donations of masks, supplies, first-aid kits, onsite medics, pastries, snacks, water bottles, fruit,  our CHOP family and our recruited ally team who attended the training and showed up with gentle ferocity to hold the space and educate those who showed up to challenge the necessity of all black healing spaces. The remaining funds will be used to cover two more event days centering healing for the black community which will take place on June 26th and 27th from 9 am-8 pm.  Again we will use the funds to cover the following:- 15 Black facilitators for art circles, grief rituals, writing circles, herbalist,  yoga, meditation, collective altar building, peace circles, orisha dance sessions etc. - To pay a professional photographer to cover both days events.- Art supplies, flower crown building supplies. - film editors to piece together the healing black stories collected. - film people for the healing black story booth round 2- Y-WE affinity leaders to train allies and serve as support staff for the duration of both events. - caterers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on both, days. - gift bags to thank the facilitators.  -website and graphic designer to make information about facilitators, organizers, and events easier to find. - and any additional related expenses that arise. *again we will be supporting black-owned business and people with all the funds (Reparations we raised for this event). For inquiring minds who would like to know here's a bit of information about the organizers1. Mary Hall-Williams: I am a 25yr old University of Washington student. I study Medical Anthropology and Global Health, maintain a 4.0 and am conducting honors research on ""Intentional and Automatic Coping Mechanisms in Response to Viral Black Death and Racism. I am a former youth Pastor. I have worked in the past with African American Reach and Teach Health Ministry (AFRATH ) on community health initiatives and sustainability and gardening initiatives for youth including the formation of a community garden and art mural. As a lead teacher at The Good Shepherd's Childcare Center. As a teacher and youth leader at Medhane-Alem Ethiopian Church of Seattle. and with youth organized homeless outreach in downtown Seattle. It's deeply irritating that we are being asked to further prove ourselves and our competence to get funds released as if our previous explanation wasn't enough. 2. Reagan Jackson (co-organizer and Director at Y-WE lead) is amazing. If you don't know about Y-WE lead I encourage you to google them and support this amazing non-profit that continues to support youth in Seattle.  Further, she is an awarded author, who has penned books, facilitates writing classes, writes columns and thinks pieces, recently taught a class at Seattle University, and who believed that we could pull off an event in 72hrs and then spent 14hrs with me out on the ground making it happen. Additionally, I would like to offer a radical reminder that black women do not owe you an explanation and that we appreciate the ways you supported not only the Amazing healing space that we made happen in 72hrs on limited energy while also working our regular job shifts and managing being human beings, but also the ways you support the black community at all times by being allies and doing the anti-racist work necessary to make the words ""all black healing space"" less controversial. Thank you to those who have donated and thank you in advance to gofundme for releasing the funds instead of being a further hindrance to what we are building for our community in a time where the hypervisibility of black death and racism are exasperated and causing the black community daily emotional distress."
Event,June Joplin: The Next Chapter,"New Orleans, LA",23730.0,125000.0,125,249,718,"On June 14, 2020, our friend June boldly and beautifully came out as a transgender woman. On July 20, June was fired from her job as a senior pastor. We are building a team around June and her family as they prepare for an uncertain future. As part of Team June, you can help alleviate some financial burdens during this time of transition. Help June with the expenses of life as she moves into this next chapter of her story so she is free to do so slowly and steadily, in wholeness and with boldness.We, her friends, have set an ambitious goal because we want to anticipate both short-term and long-term needs. We know her influence has already been far-reaching, and we trust your generosity and support will be as well. No matter what we raise, the whole of it will reach June and will speak to her of our tremendous love for her and our belief in this next chapter of her story.If you're still reading and would like to know a little more, particularly about that ambitious goal, we believe that living as her authentic self may cost June a livelihood for some time--beyond any benefits or severance she may receive. She is a great pastor and an excellent preacher, but we know that full-time pastorates for trans women are few and far between. In fact, transgender individuals in Ontario face three times the national unemployment rate, according to transequalitycanada.com. In June's sermon on June 14, she preached about holding this precious pearl, and brilliantly shared her story with the world. We know that living as their authentic selves costs too many trans people everything, and June's bold life is one we are all so lucky to witness. By contributing to Team June, you are helping to make your love known by alleviating some of the enormous costs of life."

****wow! Goal met, but let’s keep going!! The more we raise the bigger and better the celebration❤️ you all are amazing!!
*** if we go over our goal, 100% of all raised goes back into the event and just means more surprises for our seniors!! 
Help the 2020 Seniors of Tesoro have a Celebratory Event!!!These unprecedented times have been tough on all of us, especially our Tesoro 2020 Seniors.  While our district is still trying to plan a graduation date to honor our children in July, we wanted to do something to celebrate them on their original graduation date of June 4th, 2020. While our district and school cannot sponsor our event, our event will not be prevented. With much orchestration, we are celebrating our seniors on June 4th, 2020 with a Senior Celebratory Car Parade from 3:00-5:00. This is not a graduation or taking the place of any other CUSD event. Again, this is NOT a Tesoro or CUSD sponsored event. Our small committee is working with an event company to help plan and operate this event. This drive-thru celebratory car parade will follow all traffic and social distancing guidelines. No exiting from their vehicles allowed. The event company is running the event and providing all signage and cones, traffic staffing, production staff, and celebratory surprises. We have over 600 seniors and we need this company to assist us in making the event a success. We must raise ALL funds for this event to occur for our children. Any amount helps and will be greatly appreciated!"

Event,Our Black Legacy Matters: Wilfandel Preservation,"Los Angeles, CA",19010.0,250000.0,158,130,699,"https://www.wilfandelclub.com  Our Black Legacy Matters: Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign SUMMARYWilfandel Club Challenges Racial CovenantsUntil the mid 1940’s racial covenants denied African Americans access to public facilities. To address the civic need of African American Angelenos, Fannie Williams and Della Williams, wife of world-renowned architect Paul Williams, with 50 enterprising women purchased the Wilfandel, a Revival Mediterranean style house. The Wilfandel members celebrated their club’s tenth anniversary by paying off their $28,000 mortgage. They envisioned the house for individuals of all races and ethnicities to participate in civic events and family celebrations. This campaign is a collaborative effort of the multi-generational prominent African American women members who strive to continue its legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment. The ClubhouseIs located in the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Zone in Los Angeles, California and was built in 1912. The two story, 6254 sq. ft. house has 5 bedrooms, 4 baths and gardens on an expansive 18,000 sq. ft. corner lot. A detached garage is topped by a two-bedroom guest apartment. This 75-year old organization is one of the few surviving historical black organizations in Los Angeles to continue to own property.  The Wilfandel members recognize the importance of preserving the century old structure and participate in fundraising efforts that include creation of a Donor Wall, annual cultural events and grant solicitation. In June 2020, the plumbing and electrical systems were upgraded. As a result of the system upgrades and the  ‘shelter in place’ ordinance issued by Los Angeles Governor Newsom, the Wilfandel has been closed since January 1,2020 and has lost essential operational revenue.  Help Continue the Wilfandel’s legacy. It Matters! The funds raised by “Our Black Legacy Matters: The Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign” will ensure that the clubhouse continues to remain a valued and respected resource and expands its ability to serve the community. The Wilfandel Club seeks funds to renovate a one-bedroom guest apartment; create a commercial kitchen; improve, revitalize and upgrade the house; and to cover operating expenses due to  loss of rental income as a result of COVID-19.  BudgetOur campaign goal is to raise $500,000.General operations - $30,000 due to loss of rental income as a result of COVID-19Preservation - $50,000Renovation - $170,000 #GivingTuesday#Wilfandellegacy#Blackwomenmatter#Blackscholarship#Blackcivicengagement#Blacklegacy#Blackwomenempowerment Campaign DetailsWho We Are, What We Do and Why it Matters!Until the mid 1940’s racial covenants prevented African Americans access to public facilities. As a result, blacks were not able to join celebrations, attend seminars or participate in cultural events held at public locations . To address the needs of African American Angelenos, Fannie Williams and Della Williams, wife of world-renowned architect Paul Williams, with 50 enterprising women purchased the Wilfandel, a Revival Mediterranean style house. They envisioned the house for individuals of all races and ethnicities to participate in civic events and family celebrations. This campaign is a collaborative effort of the multi-generational African American women Wilfandel members who range in age from 45 to 95. We represent a wide spectrum of industries and professions with high stations in government, executive positions in academia and executive positions in the private sector.  We joined the Wilfandel to preserve its legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment.  We share fond memories of attending art exhibits, book signings, poetry readings, workshops, seminars, lectures, rituals, celebrations and civic meetings with our family, members of the community and noteworthy individuals at the Wilfandel. Other professional and nonprofit organizations also schedule events at the stunning edifice. Over the decades, the Susan B. Komen Foundation, Language Immersion Charter School, Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers, LA Association of Black Professionals, Top Ladies of Distinction Inc and St. Bridget Catholic Church have held exquisite events at the house. As a nonprofit, the Wilfandel offers reduced rental rates to similar organizations. Wilfandel Club Challenges Racial CovenantsIn 1945 the 50 visionary, trailblazing African American women purchased the house after raising funds for the down payment over a 3-year period. The ladies celebrated their club’s tenth anniversary with the payoff of their $28,000 mortgage.  The ClubhouseIs located in the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), in Los Angeles, California and was built in 1912. The two story, 6254 sq. ft. house has 5 bedrooms, 4 baths and gardens on an expansive 18,000 sq. ft. corner lot. A detached garage is topped by a one-bedroom guest apartment. The ground floor houses the club’s business office, a large kitchen and dining area, the lanai and the public rooms used for countless meetings, lectures, concerts and charitable activities. On the upper floor are the separate ‘Bride’ and ‘Groom’ suites and a conference room. Although the Wilfandel is not a historically designated landmark, it is highly regarded by the Los Angeles Conversancy, the largest preservation organization in the United States. Located in the preservation zone signifies that the house has historic, architectural, cultural or aesthetic significance. The Wilfandel is currently reviewing the requirements of the City of Los Angeles Cultural Heritage commission to determine if the house will qualify as a Los Angeles Cultural Monument.  75-Year Legacy of Cultural SignificanceThe club provides people of all races and cultures affordable access to an elegant venue for social and civic activities. We recognize the importance of remaining relevant as the demographics of the surrounding community continue to change. Over the years the nonprofit has been vital to the civic infrastructure of LA’s black community. Recognition of the historic legacy of the West Adams community and the ability to respond to the needs of the surrounding areas, are essential to the future of The Wilfandel Club. Wilfandel Fundraising EffortsThe members recognize preservation as a cost effective way to remain relevant in the community and have participated in several efforts to generate capital. In 2013, the Restoration and Preservation fundraiser was launched and a Donor Wall exhibits the benefactor’s names prominently displayed in the lanai.  The Wilfandel was recently awarded a grant to $75,000 to preserve historic African American cultural sites. The funds were allocated to make plumbing, electric and foundation upgrades to the 1912 building. The Wilfandel board decided the clubhouse would be closed January through April 2020 to complete the upgrades. In March, the members hosted a cultural fundraiser at the Nate Holden Performing Art Center in Los Angeles. The proceeds have been used to cover general operating expenses. In total, the club has raised approximately $125,000 for preservation and operations. Challenges: Impact of COVID-19 and Social Distancing EventsSince April when Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that Los Angeles would ‘shelter in place’ to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, the Wilfandel has been closed.  COVID – 19 has severely affected the Wilfandel’s ability to receive essential rental revenue. As Los Angeles prepares to reopen, the members are in the process of determining how to effectively enforce social distancing at all club events.  Preservation and RenovationCompleted and Remaining UpgradesThe plumbing and electrical upgrades were completed in April 2020. Given the age of the structure, the building understandably requires regular maintenance and repairs. The remaining grant funds will be used to plaster, paint and fix the crumbling foundation that was identified in a recent inspection. The board is also aware of the need to update the house to be Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant. RenovationThe guest apartment over the garage has sustained significant damage. The roof, plumbing and electrical systems need repair along with the structural damage to the walls and flooring. Since affordable housing is one of Los Angeles most pressing issues, the renovation of the guesthouse could provide affordable housing to address the shortage and a source of income for the club. Additionally we envision creating a commercial kitchen out of the existing conventional one. There is no commercial kitchen available to prepare food for catered events within a 4-mile radius of the property. The kitchen could be rented out to qualified and vetted chefs as another source of income. The ProcessStructural integrity and public safety are our primary concerns.  Consistent with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards and Principles, special consideration will be given to the historic use and the original design aesthetics of the property.  Construction will adhere to local standards and all current building codes. All work will be conducted by a licensed contractor, the proper building permits will be obtained and all inspections completed and approved. BudgetOur campaign goal is to raise $500,000.General operations - $30,000 due to loss of rentals as a result of COVID-19Preservation - $50,000Renovation - $170,000 Help Continue the Wilfandel’s legacy. It Matters! A 2018 study conducted by the Los Angeles Conservancy Commission found that historic places contribute to the overall livability of the city and provides real value for every Angelenos.  As an historic civic organization our goals are service, sustainability, longevity and continued relevance.  The funds raised by “Our Black Legacy Matters: The Wilfandel Preservation and Legacy Campaign” will ensure that the clubhouse continues to remain a valued and respected resource and expand its ability to serve the community. The Wilfandel Club seeks funds to renovate a one-bedroom guest apartment; create a commercial kitchen; improve, revitize and upgrade to preserve the structure; and to cover operating expenses due to a loss of rental income as a result of COVID-19. We seek to build our online and social media presence and to forge deeper relationships and collaborations with institutions, our neighbors and the Los Angeles community at large. We envision the clubhouse as a unique and wonderful destination for scheduled civic events throughout the year. The Wilfandel’s cultural significance legacy matters. When the club reaches its campaign goal, it will not only continue its 75-year legacy of community outreach through civic betterment, philanthropic endeavors, scholarship and cultural enrichment but will also revitalize this precious community resource owned by African American women.Please join the Preservation and Legacy campaign!

Event,#SaveSoulFest,"Merrimac, MA",16397.0,150000.0,187,154,431,"These are hard times for many and while it’s hard to ask for help,SoulFest’s future depends on it.

SoulFest, an annual 3-day Christian Music Festival focused on Music, Love, & Action, is produced by New Sound Concerts, Inc., a 501c3 started by Dan and Alison Russell in 1978 to bring Christian music to New England. SoulFest’s purpose is to celebrate God’s love and encourage all who attend to live from the inside out as soul-connected, risk-taking Believers in God’s love. The first SoulFest was held in 1998 at Loon Mountain, in Lincoln, NH, and is approaching its 23rd celebration, which will be held at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, NH (host location since 2004). New Sound Concerts has been producing and promoting Christian concerts in New England for over 40 years and finds itself at a crossroads to carry on.

With little revenue coming in due to the impact of COVID-19,compounding previous debt, our attention is also turned towards the Russell family as they focus on Dan’s recovery from his mid-April stroke and ensuing medical bills.

SoulFest experienced a large financial loss in 2019; we were working hard to implement new ideas and focusing on a fresh lineup to make up for the loss, which was working until COVID-19 hit American soil. When ticket sales slowed, plus vendors and sponsors were being financially impacted and pulling back, closing that gap became more difficult, let alone continuing to pay our small staff. Our paycheck protection loan delayed, forcing layoffs just as SoulFest co-founder, Dan Russell, had a stroke affecting his left (dominant) side. As a singer-songwriter working on his second album, and the creative voice behind SoulFest, this has been incredibly hard on Dan, his family, and the broad community of SoulFest friends beyond the New Sound team.It became apparent that by August in New Hampshire, we would likely not be able to hold an event, even to the size of 2019, forget about increasing attendance. Costs would increase to provide for new social distancing protocols, coupling with low attendance, and put us even further in debt. Postponing became our only option. The live music landscape and gatherings are greatly changed for 2020 and beyond, though we have hope and great anticipation for what they will look like in 2021. This is a highly innovative time in our history. We are pivoting, regrouping, listening, and moving forward.

It’s not all grim, but the legacy and continuation of New SoundConcerts and the SoulFest depend heavily on the support of itspatrons and anyone who cares to continue to see this communityand gathering sustained in New England. This annual event supports the local economy by bringing 8,000-10,000 people to the Laconia area to experience spiritual growth, rejuvenation, and adventure, sending them back inspired to take LOVE into their homes, communities, and around the globe.We need to raise funds to support the New Sound Concerts team in finding a sustainable path forward with the changing landscape for live events and the Russell family through this time of recovery and healing. This $150,000 will provide stability to navigate the new terrain of gathering around SoulFest’s mission, ensuring its platform continues to share the hope and love of God through music.Any amount helps #SaveSoulFest. Exceeding this goal does too."

Whether you call him Mark, Marky, Mr. Lipson or Slippy, you know that this man's generous heart shines in all that he does.The layers of crisis are real and very dire, but we can help lighten the load. Mark has done so much for the organic sector and this earth-connected community we call home. Now it’s our turn to show him how much we care.Over his 40 years of service, Mark has mentored and supported many of today’s organizational leaders. The list of his volunteer and community-building achievements is endless. I, Liz Birnbaum, founder and CEO of The Curated Feast, am one of the lucky mentees. I also lovingly call him my adopted California dad (though I've done that behind his back until now).You know that Mark is one of the original founders of the organic movement we have today. You know that he was the first paid employee of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), and among so many other professional and community accomplishments, has been a Partner at Molino Creek Farm since 1983.But did you know that Mark is under tremendous stress and very much needs our help?As he turns 64 (what I’ll always think of as Sgt. Pepper age) on October 19th, it's not only time to reflect on this man’s tremendous gifts to the world, but it’s time to step up and support him.These funds will make it possible to:+ Repair the infrastructure of Mark and Cassandra’s home (the many parts not covered by insurance).+ Repair the domestic water and fire-fighting supply—which we know will be essential in the coming years.+ Remove approx. 500 (literal) tons of Douglas Fir tree that came down in the front yard.+ Create an additional living space for on-site help (one of Cass and Mark’s kids) for fire recovery and Cassandra’s care.+ Upgrade Mark’s vehicle, which was damaged due to the fire, so he has transportation for an upcoming wet winter. Searching for the C word(s).Mark has been his partner Cassandra's primary caregiver since her cancer diagnosis in 2019. As she completed her treatment in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, severely hindering Mark’s ability to regain viable work. Cass now needs surgery imminently due to unforeseen rare complications.A 20-year cancer survivor himself and someone who lives with congenital heart condition that has required multiple surgeries, Mark also carries the burden of personal health concerns.Then came the fire.The CZU Complex Fires tremendously damaged the Molino Creek Farm Collective. Mark’s home was thankfully not destroyed (because of hero Bob Frank!), however the damage to the land and community was immense. Busy managing the Molino Creek Farm GoFundMe and other disaster recovery, he personally needs our support!Molino Creek is covered in ash. I went up to Molino Creek last weekend, and seeing the dome, the land, and the lines that fire burned on the homes gave me tears, goosebumps, and deep shock. The impact on the hearts and minds of the whole community cannot be overstated.Folks, these are tough times for all. The only way we’re going to get through this is by loving and supporting one another as we each carry the burden of challenging times and a changing climate. Right now, it’s time to surround Mark and Cass with support and love. Anything you can do that will give him a birthday boost will be appreciated with virtual hugs and/or kisses (by request) from Mark himself."

Many of you have been asking what you can do to honor our seniors.  We have decided to use the collected funds from the Senior All Night Party, which they will also miss out on, to give EVERY senior a special gift.  Due to the fact that many of our fund raisers had to be cancelled, we are way short of the money we need to give these kids the special send off they deserve.  We know that nothing can replace the cherished memories they would have made during this time, but we are hoping that this gift will at least give them a lasting memory of their time at Fraser High School and let them know how much as a community we care.  Please know that 100% of all contributions will go directly to our 2020 senior class in the form of various gifts to remember this special time in their lives."

Since then, we have been working diligently to make sure President Trumps re-election is a success. Unfortunately, we have had to face some major obstacles with our vehicle and the bridge. We have traveled to all 48 continental states with hopes and dreams of one day making it to Alaska and Hawaii. Our truck was taken through a high speed chase after being stolen and resulted in a crash. It was driven over curbs and through trees. It resulted in extensive damage. The truck has already had 4 engine replacement and now needs another.  The transmission had to be replaced and the truck just really needs to be upgraded. It is critical that we have reliable transportation so we can keep traveling all around the United States and keep our message of support and appreciation  to  President Trump going. With the election just weeks away it is more important than ever, that we are on the road helping to reassure that President Trumps re-election efforts are a success.

 need help to continue. If you could share this campaign and get our story out to everyone we would be more than grateful. If you are inclined to donate we appreciate your kindness and help in achieving our goal."

That this fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness didn’t start with the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, but it began when the first ships invaded these shores. That we can no longer celebrate our country without reckoning with our past and present. That this country is founded on the genocide of indigenous nations, the theft of their land, and the enslavement of African peoples. That the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness brand that America markets is a dangerous myth as we continue to oppress, dehumanize, and murder. That unless we all commit to fight for the lives and rights of black, brown, indigenous, and other marginalized peoples, we will all continue to suffer the violence of systemic racism and white supremacy. That is why this 4th of July we refuse to celebrate the whitewashing of this country. Instead, we will joyously and actively celebrate and honor the ancestors and activists who have fought and continue to fight tirelessly for the lives and rights of the people."" **The Coalition to Honor Black and Indigenous Activists is a group of mostly LGBTQ activists who have worked together for decades and film professionals who know how to get things done.**"

Event,Birthday Car,"Alamo, CA",11540.0,10000.0,147,29,206,"My dear friend, Joe, needs help! He is like a father to me & it breaks my heart to see how completely overwhelmed he is. He is 78 years old and lost his wife suddenly in February, after 42 years together- along with the income that she contributed.  They have no children together.  Shortly afterwards Covid 19 hit and Joe has been forced into isolation while deeply grieving.  Now, his landlord has suggested that  his lease may not be renewed and his car has stopped running. For his birthday, on June 30, I started this page, in hopes that any of you might be willing to add your support towards the purchase of a replacement used car.   Joe has worked hard all of his life, has sacrificed much to care for Jane & others & is a good man."
Event,Help celebrate SSHS class of 2020!,"Steamboat Springs, CO",11103.0,10000.0,215,147,577,"Life has changed for all of us very quickly, but for the Steamboat Springs High School Class of 2020, it's been heartbreaking. They have lost their senior prom, all senior activities (camping, ditch day, etc), their senior sports seasons, and their graduation ceremony. The also unknowingly had their very last day of school, without the opportunity to hug their friends or teachers goodbye. They are unable to be together during this time to grieve their losses together. We are asking that the community of Steamboat, and the people who love the SSHS Class of 2020, help support our efforts to celebrate these seniors as much as we can.  The funds we raise will go to the cost of two 60 ft banners that will hang above Lincoln Ave in downtown Steamboat, showcasing each of their smiling faces. We are also hoping to fund individual personalized yard signs that will be displayed publicly, which students/families can keep as a memento. The 2020 class officers are working on additional ways to celebrate graduation, but our goal is to try and rally the town that we all love, to support and celebrate these seniors- the only class of Steamboat Springs High School that has ever had to forgo an in-person graduation ceremony. Any funds not used will be donated back to SSHS to help fund a celebration for the Class of 2020 scheduled later this summer. The Class of 2020 will be always remembered for what was taken from them, during the most uncertain time any of us have every lived through. They WILL persevere,  and this will only make them stronger than we already know they are. Thank you for your support- GO SAILORS!  #2020STRONG"

Event,Race and Splash for Leah,"Ledyard, CT",10750.0,3800.0,134,139,966,"Leah Suminski passed away on June 13, 2020 after a long battle with breast cancer. This year, on September 9, she would have been 38 years old. Our goal is to earn $100 for every year of her life by holding a 5k/1 mile race in her memory, followed by a splash in the ocean (or lake, river, pool, puddle). Due to COVID-19 this is a virtual race, but looking forward to an in-person race in the future. 

Sometimes when families are dealing with cancer they feel overwhelmed and alone. Last September, Leah, Sam and the boys went on a free week-long trip to Michigan, paid for by The Little Pink Houses of Hope. There they met several other families dealing with the exact same things that they were. It was so comforting to be around people with the same fears, challenges, hopes, and dreams. In Michigan, they found a new family--their “Little Pink Family”. Leah wanted people to donate to Little Pink Houses of Hope in lieu of funeral services when she passed. I know it would make her so happy to know that more families get to enjoy a week away in her memory.

Thank you for considering donating to her cause!"
Event,Penny's Retirement Celebration!,"Ellenwood, GA",10665.0,10000.0,149,127,34,"After 42+ years of dedicated service as an Administrative Professional who helped others with an untiring drive of pure energy that was always presented with a smile and love, our beloved Penny Wolfe is retiring on July 17, 2020.Penny has undoubtedly touched in many unmeasurable ways every man and woman who ever worked for the Fulton County Fire Rescue Department where she started her career soon after it was formed in 1978.  Like me, you may have received the ""phone call"" and heard her voice offering you a job.  Over the years, Penny listened to many of our problems.  Once the issue was in her hands, if at all possible it would be resolved.  Calling Penny and having her call you by your first name was sometimes surprising and always a reassuring moment.  In order to give retirees an opportunity to come together to share a laugh and tell war stories, Penny has organized the Retiree's Breakfast for over fifteen years, to include sending the inivatations, purchasing the food and creating gifts and those coveted ID cards.   And, she has become the Chief Correspondent for all news, celebrating the accomplishments of others and tenderly sharing the moments of sorrow.   Once FCFRD responded to its last call, Penny transitioned to the City of South Fulton Fire Rescue Department and continued to positively impact the careers of many. Her most recent assignment has been with the City of South Fulton HR team.  She was transferred from the fire department because her highly regarded qualities and skills were immediately recognized by the City management team. Hopefully, we all can come together to celebrate Penny with a good ol' fashioned fire station retirement dinner after this COVID-19 event.  For now you can celebrate her and show your love by supporting a dream that she has shared over the years.   That dream is to take a sightseeing road trip with her husband David along the east coast.  Also, Penny enjoys woodworking.  Where does she find the time...?  I am sure she will purchase the latest tool to add to her ever-growing workshop. I hope you will support this fitting gift for a wonderful person and friend who had the utmost respect for firefighters and believed that her job was to make life a little easier for all of us.  In her own words, as written in the FCFRD 25th anniversary yearbook, she stated: My role here has always been in a support capacity, assisting our members in whatever their needs may be.   Now, when I think back to times when I have helped someone, at the end of our conversation when they say ""thank you"" and I say ""my pleasure""...it really has been.  Though Penny never donned bunker gear and fought fire beside you, she was an essential part of the team (family) who was always ready to help.  It is now our time to appropriately welcome her to the D-Shift.   Let's meet or exceed the goal!!!The total amount will be presented to Penny on July 16th or 17th (her last day in the office). Feel free to pass this info to anyone who you think will want to participate. But, LET'S KEEP THIS A SECRET, do not use old mass emails or post to social media because she may be a part of the group. Thank you,"

Event,Beta Gamma Alumni Step Up for UCLA Fall Rush,"San Francisco, CA",10551.0,10000.0,76,46,72,"UCLA DELTA SIGMA PHI ALUMNI BROTHERS:  the momentum of the Beta Gamma chapter is undeniable.  Last year, we had the biggest fall pledge class in history.  When campus was effectively shut down by Covid last spring, our chapter still managed to identify, rush and pledge six new members -- online!  They did it with determination, effort and a little ""secret sauce.""The secret sauce was provided by the Alumni Control Board.  Specifically, the ACB agreed to fund the initiation fees charged by National and the chapter for new members.  Thus, young men who wanted to join (we used to call them ""rushees"") were able to tell their families that they could join a fraternity without incurring any upfront costs. When all was said and done, the new member feedback to the chapter was that the sponsored initiation fees was a difference-maker in the decision to join the house.ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE:  This fall, the ACB is getting tight on funds. It is not in a position to cover the $474 per person in new member fees as it did in the spring.  That's where we come in.  Your involvement can really make a difference.  Will you provide the chapter with $474 to cover the costs of a single new member?  We hope to have ten or more new members join us, so we’re looking for at least $4,740 here.Regardless of what other UCLA fraternities are doing, Beta Gamma will rush, and rush aggressively.  The actives need to network and reach out to prospects with a strong message.  The difficulty of the challenge will be compounded because the IFC is not providing fraternities with a list of freshmen men interested in fraternities.   Also, UCLA has drastically reduced the number of students living in the dorms.  With Covid, most rooms at 620 Landfair are for two guys.  At this time, we have 18 actives planning to live in the house for fall.  This leaves 5-8 unused beds in the house that could be offered to new members.  Chapter Advisor Preston Briggs and ACB Chair David Gonzalez believe there are many students who will want to get away from home to live in the UCLA area.  This brings us to . . . ALUMNI OPPORTUNITY NUMBER TWO:  Preston Briggs, David Gonzalez and I would like to see if the alumni could fund one or more new member rooms for the fall quarter only at no cost to the student.  The per person quarterly rent is $2,490.  So, we are looking to gather as many multiples of $2,490 as possible.  Our actives have proven they know how to rush.  Can we count on you for $100, $250, $500 or $1,000 to reward their hard work and get this program rolling?  As with the new member fees, we believe the housing offer will prove very attractive.  In the long run, Beta Gamma will reap the benefits, as it preserves momentum and continues to grow at a time when other houses are losing members.  Thank you, and YITBOS!"

Event,"""To Miami, with Love"" The Exhibit","Miami Beach, FL",10635.0,10000.0,75,49,1,"Imagine this, you are one of Miami’s most sought after DJs, booking gigs at the likes of LIV, Miami Broward Carnival and completing a whirlwind weekend of Super Bowl LIV events at the renowned Karu&Y with Headliner Market Group. Life is great! Unbeknownst to you, your last gig would be alongside the official DJ of the Miami Heat, DJ Irie and the City of Miami Beach for what would have been a Spring Break concert series for the history books. Then, in what seemed like the blink of an eye, your entire world shuts down. Restaurants and bars close, hotels and night clubs lock their doors. Enter the era of Covid-19. This is the story of Rahsaan ""DJ Fly Guy"" Alexander. Having amassed a 10-year career as the “high energy Rahsaan made a name for himself in the South Florida entertainment industry. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Rahsaan’s career had taken a devastating blow. As we closed out the first month of quarantine, a scary reality began to set in; he may never return to DJ in the beloved clubs and bars on Miami Beach. Depression and anxiety were only two of many different emotions that affected the mental health and stability of Rahsaan.  He knew that he would need to pivot, but challenges presented themselves at every turn and he questioned whether he would be able to continue to provide the soundtrack of the iconic Miami nightlife. In a moment of solitude and deep inflection, Rahsaan made a decision that would ultimately change the course of the remainder of his year. He charged himself with the task of reigniting the zest and enthusiasm he once had for an old love of his, photography. In this same moment another clear and finite decision was made. He would need to take the money he had saved and invest it in redeveloping and refining his once suppressed passion for this creative art form.This pivotal moment quickly went from taking photos for leisure to intentionally capturing moments in time within the city he calls home, Miami. To further his new passion project, Rahsaan has now decided to debut his photojournalist artwork at an exhibition event in December 2020. He is asking for your financial assistance to make this dream come true."

What you might not know is that he has served as ED as a volunteer for many of those years - donating his time, energy, and brilliance to the organization.Throughout his two decades of involvement with RCFL, PK has deeply impacted the Harrison Neighborhood in North Minneapolis, the broader Twin Cities Lutheran Community, and almost everyone who walks through Redeemer’s doors. With his gentle demeanor and fierce passion for justice, PK has touched the hearts and minds of countless program participants, staff members, and supporters.

She has delivered newspapers every weekend the entire time for about 15 hours a weekend.”  She has also worked at Friendly’s, been a Door Dasher, and probably more - all so that she could pour into the lives of countless boys and girls and young men and women.  Anyone who knows her well also knows how much she serves behind the scenes, often working late at night and on weekends.As a way of honoring all the sacrifices Nancy has made in the last 31 years, would you make a sacrificial donation?  She has given so much to so many for so long!100% of the donations will go directly to her.Would you also post a comment with a favorite memory of Nancy, the first words that come to mind when you think of her, or some other word of encouragement?  Please keep it positive - let’s make this a celebration of her!Please share this post as well.Thanks!"

This year has honestly been rough as most of you guys know with the pandemic going on. . But aside from that our personal lives he has been in and out of the hospital since March 2020 . With multiple surgeries going on , having to recover ,then going back in again for another procedure, his body was physically exhausted. The hospitals would not let anyone in due to covid 19. Neurn Phon was in there alone trying to recover and staying strong for his family... He went back in again to the emergency room on July 5, then got transferred to intensive care unit on July 6 yesterday morning. The doctors then made their final decision and had called the siblings to inform them that their father/ husband does not have much time left. The siblings and their mother rushed to the hospital where they got to say their good byes to him. Removing a ventilator on him, he then took his last breath and went in peace...

Event,PHS Alumni Showing Love to Class of 2020,"Pullman, WA",9142.0,6500.0,203,173,1.1K,"Imagine you are a senior in high school with 3 months to graduation day—you are filled with excitement, anxiety for the unknown, anticipating new adventures, making plans for college, and you cannot wait to walk down the Beasley Coliseum stairs to Pomp and Circumstance and switch over that tassel after you receive your hard-earned diploma. And suddenly, a pandemic hits the nation and changes all of your plans, celebrations, and normal graduation traditions. That is the reality for the PHS Class of 2020.

For these approximately 220 students, there will be no spring sports or final senior games/meets, no theater plays, no senior prom, no senior skip, no senior choir, no graduation party, no signing yearbooks, no graduation parties with extended family and friends, and no official goodbyes to teachers, friends and under-classmates (at least none of these things in the traditional sense). To that end, we are asking all former PHS classes to join together to support the Class of 2020. Here is the plan:1) Our goal is to raise $5,0002) The money will go towards purchasing gift cards from local Pullman businesses (Side Note: let’s help our local economy and community in the process too). The hope is that we can raise enough to provide a $20 gift card to each student.3) These gift cards will be given to students when they pick up their caps and gowns on May 21st. We will include a note with the gift card that mentions all the PHS classes that participate. 4) Deadline for donations—in order to purchase the gift cards and get them to PHS in time, we kindly ask that all donations are made by May 15th. Please indicate your graduation class/year along with your donation in the comments. Please know that all people are welcome to donate to this cause—teachers, community members, etc. Any and all donation amounts will be accepted and appreciated—we know this is a hard time for many, but no donation amount is too small. This effort will take a village. If any community can pull this off, it’s Pullman and the alumni of PHS! Thank you in advance for rallying to support the graduates of 2020!

Special thanks and acknowledgements to Megan Vogt (Symons), Jessica Nazario (Caldwell) and Paula Moore (Faas) for being the braintrust of these creative ideas listed above."
Event,We love you Daniel,"Daly City, CA",9007.0,20000.0,56,85,858,"On Monday September 28. 2020, my brother was tragically robbed of his life.  While getting settled into his new home, he was approached by a small group of people who were looking for a friend. While explaining that he had no knowledge of his whereabouts the discussion took a wrong turn and resulted in my brother being shot and killed. Daniel has struggled a lot during his short time here on earth but no matter what he always did his best to help out his family and his friends. He didn't have all the riches of the world, but he had heart. He moved genuinely. If you were around Daniel anything he had you had. If you needed anything that he had to spare it was yours. Daniel devoted a lot of his time to his family and friends. 
We would appreciate anything you can contribute to the family during this difficult time ."

Event,Rebecca & Jasmine's Wedding Fund,"Richmond, VA",8855.0,44000.0,138,212,978,"“I want people to know that I love you,” Jasmine told Rebecca on an afternoon in late spring 2020. Rebecca, of course, replied with a resounding and incredibly on-brand, “BET,” and thus the scheming began. Days later, Rebecca rolled up to Jasmine’s backyard with a bullhorn, a protest sign and a simple message: “Black Love Matters,” formally asking for Jasmine’s hand in booship. How we met:The first time was in 2016 at a Juvenile Justice seminar in the Richmond Public Library’s Main Branch. We know what you’re thinking, we locked eyes from across the room, mouths agape, music swelling, turtle doves materializing from thin air; but the truth is that Jasmine actually first witnessed the beauty of Rebecca…..…’s shoes. These oil slick shoes first gifted to them were now a gift unto the world! Working the table in the back while simultaneously working the hell out of these dark, rouge-tinted statement makers, we bonded over the moment, enjoying each other’s style and energy in a moment that felt like we’d been friends before.  Newly in love (again, with the shoes) legend has it was here that Jasmine confirmed that if Rebecca was walking through the world like this, she’d be down to walk side by side wherever they’re going.Our friendship grew and deepened after May of 2018 when we were called to respond to a catalytic event in our lives and Richmond: the police murder of 26-year-old, black educator Marcus-David Peters. Peters, who was experiencing a mental health crisis was met with lethal force at the hands of Richmond law enforcement when he needed help.We spent hours around a wooden table in the basement of Second Baptist Church West End, with our comrades, faith leaders and a grieving yet resilient family. There, we decided to make it impossible for this city to forget the name Marcus-David Peters.That work has led to countless marches, town halls, teach-ins, art builds, op-eds, and hundreds of people being politicized all for the Justice and Reformation movement. Our lives were bound to this duty then, and we continue to commit our lives to that mission now, a commitment we made together. Juneteenth engagement: At midnight on Juneteenth, the day Black people celebrate our emancipation from slavery, we made the choice to commit our lives to one another through marriage. It felt so surreal, and so right. Our time organizing together has continued to lead us to a place of deep trust, healthy communication, and creative problem solving; the cornerstones of any meaningful relationship. We know that we are our ancestor’s wildest dreams, and we are making a commitment to make them proud with our union, loving and nourishing one another through marriage.  The ask:For our wedding, we have made the decision to raise funds to afford it. We’ve witnessed firsthand what little miracles can happen when a community comes together and we are asking for your help in making this possible. The funds that you contribute will go to sufficiently compensating our talented comrades and friends who are our florists, musicians, officiants, cooks, photographers, and artists of varying media. Our friends and comrades have answered the calls to action for justice by donating their time, talent, and energy to the movement. Your donation will also cover the cost of materials needed to pull off our country queer farm wedding and keep our guests safe during  COVID-19. We expect that some friends and comrades may refuse compensation, in which case we will donate their payment to an organization or individual of their choosing and find a creative way to thank them directly.  If we exceed our goal, those funds will be split between Southerner’s On New Ground and our nest egg fund which is being organized by our queer fam. We want this day to be shared, redistributing funds to our people and celebrating our love the best way we know how to. Together.  Black love is essential."

She contacted me a few days back via messenger with her number and we had a great conversation on the phone as she was interested in attending to the March on August 28th as she supported and understands the movement. I let her know she would not be there alone and could and would be connected to us and other going from Portland/ Oregon if she chose to go as she wanted to assist me there if she decided to go.This evening she contacted me and after she gave it careful thought this was her decision and I it thought was worthy of sharing...#TextFromAnita:Hi Joe. I have been thinking about my trip to Washington to be there for the march, and about my motives. I wonder if my money might be better put to use to support BIPOC/families who have been affected by police violence, who want to go but could use financial help. So I am thinking of instead of going, donating $700 to your fund.Portland Observer 7/8/2020Support is growing for a bereaved father from Portland’s Black community who is leading a group of individuals from families like his to Washington, D.C. for the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington to promote racial justice and demand action to stop unjust police shootings.Joe “Bean” Keller, who lost his son in a Portland police shooting back in 1996, is leading the delegation of at least a dozen other Portlanders to the Aug. 28 march organized by Al Sharpton’s National Action NetworkKeller told the Portland Observer that thanks to $10,000 in donations that had been generated by a Go Fund Me account through Monday, he and two members of his family and members of at least 12 other families in Portland will attend the anniversary event. All of the planned participants have lost a family member at the hands of police.The aim now is to attract even more donations to make it possible for another 10 Portland family members impacted by police violence to travel to Washington, D.C. to raise their voices for racial justice.The upcoming march commemorates the 1963 March on Washington in which Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial, but it comes with additional significance this year because of the Memorial Day police custody death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man whose “knee-choke hold” death in Minneapolis sparked continued protests in Portland and across the nation demanding action on racial justice.Keller said because of the financial support, the march is going to include individuals from several Portland families that “know the pain” of what it is like when a son or daughter is murdered at the hands of police, like when his son “Deontae J. Keller was shot in the back, handcuffed and left to die by then Portland Police Officer Terry Kruger 24 years ago.Other individuals planning on attending, Keller says, represent mostly other members of the Black community in Portland who had loved ones killed at the hands of police, including Kendra James, James Jahar Perez, Aaron Campbell, Byron Hamick, Rickey Johnson, Quanice Hayes, Keaton Otis, Jason Washington and Carlos Hunter.Keller said that while the ultimate goal is to change the hearts of Americans when it comes to taking action to stop racial injustice, participating in the march is expected to be part of the healing process for family members still struggling over the loss of their loved ones.Donations are still being accepted to help make the visit to Washington, D.C. a reality for the Portland families who wish to attend. You can give financial support by visiting the Go Fund Me site http://gf.me/u/x7ywtj.So far, a generous contribution of $5,000 from Don’t Shoot Portland, the organization led by Teressa Raiford, is the largest and only donation received from organizations representing the black community thus far, Keller said. Raiford, who just finished an unsuccessful campaign for Mayor in the May Primary, also gave an additional individual contribution of $500. Former Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard donated $100.!!!  So far I have chosen 12 family member (2 from each family) that lost a love one to Portland Police to attend the March On Washington.

Covid-19 of 2020 caused my siblings to become deathly ill and some hospitalized for a significant length of time; thereby causing our family farm Circle “R” to horrifically suffer of non -operation.  Also in our area the Cattle Stock yards and Meat Processing Centers were closed not allowing us to sell our livestock to maintain the farm. Therefore we had no resources to hire farm help to assist with maintaining the farm while my brothers were ill with Corona Virus.  Additionally, monetary resources were loss from our crops production of not being able to be sold to local stores. To date, stores were not accepting locally grown crops not certified through USDA standards due Covid-19. Literally no resources are flowing our way to sustain his farm operation. Our goal is to raise $500k to retain the ownership and operation of our inherited family farm. Mr. Roberts is a 3rd Generation Farmer that operates and maintains the original 40 acres of land provided by the Land Allotment Act of Emancipation Proclamation.    Mr. Roberts is trying to sustain his generational handed down land while simultaneously assisting his community to live healthier lives. This is done by providing his community with locally grown raised and harvested foods.  This the best and cheapest way to go, since they are not factory farms that rely on artificial growth hormones and unnatural living conditions for the animals in order to maximize profits.  As a local farmer he’s able to provide direct information when asked about his livestock, what they are fed, and their prices in order to determine what will best fit your family’s needs and budget."

Mathew 25 : 34-4034 Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; 36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’37 “Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ 40 And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’Hebrew 13 :1-31 Let brotherly love continue. 2 Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels. 3 Remember the prisoners as if chained with them—those who are mistreated—since you yourselves are in the body also.James 1:26-2726: If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless. 27: Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."

Our Troop and the overall mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young men to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the scout oath and law. Scouting is a Leadership program, our young scouts have fun camping, working with the community and studying science, medicine, engineering, politics, journalism, business, finance and project management.Our Troop does not have enough funds to replace the equipment without passing this burden onto our young men and their families. All the funds raised will be used to replace the gear and trailer.Whether you are able to give or not, please keep the boys of Troop 914 in your prayers.

(Acts 13:22). Although David had a strong desire to build the Temple of God, he was not permitted to do so. The chance was given to his son Solomon. We are chosen like Solomon!Let's remind ourselves the prayer of David (Ps 132:1-5)1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:2 How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,5 Until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.Let's rise up in the spirit of David and purchase our church building!!!By the grace of God, the prayer and beseeching of our Father the Head of our church, the prayer and support of the faithful children of God let's purchase our church building to have a lasting place for the Ark of The Covenant and a place of prayers and refuge for the faithful.The building is to be purchased in the name of our church, for the use of our church and for the benefit of the faithful children of God. Let's rejoice and give with joy for we have received the bounties of God May the peace of God be upon us allDebre Menkirat Kidus Amanuel & Rufael Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church"

Help Save the MAS Iowa Masjid and Community Center from Foreclosur.
This is an urgent message to the American Muslim community to save a local masjid building and a MAS community Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The masjid is in an urgent need for a $30,000 to be paid before october in order to save the building from going for foreclosure.  The masjid building was purchased back in 2010 for the price of $1 million. Throughout the last nine years about $700,000 have been paid. 
Quick Facts: 

The MAS Center in Iowa serves 200 refugee families monthly through free groceries, furniture donations and access to vital resources.

The center helped set up more than a dozen businesses run by refugees from Somalia and Iraq.

150 local-income families and senior citizens receive free groceries weekly through the center.

100+ community members pray Jumuah at the center every week where the five daily prayers are also conducted.

The center offers Quran and Tajweed classes, Judo and Karate classes, matrimonial services, community events and more.

A full gymnasium offers Muslim youth numerous opportunities for recreational activities.

The MAS Iowa Center has never faced foreclosure before and is diligent in making its payments.

With your contributions, we hope to continue the legacy of supporting our community for many years to come! 
MAS Iowa Center's Current Payment Arrangement:
The total remaining payoff amount on the masjid after completing this $30,000 payment is $290,000, which is scheduled to be paid at a rate of $95,000/year for the next three years. Payments are structured as following: $3,200/month, which we have never failed to pay and $58,000 once in May of each year, which we had difficulty in paying this year because of the pandemic. MAS Iowa was able to make a $28,000 payment and asks for your help in collecting $30,000 to pay the remaining in order to stave off foreclosure.
 
All your donations to MAS Iowa are tax deductible.

Yes, we know, it's a weird time right now for a lot of things, especially starting a new church (and raising money for it). But we are just crazy enough to believe Jesus when He says stuff like ""You are my hands and feet"" and ""Go love your neighbor and help people follow me."" And because of that, we have this undeniable confidence that this moment, this wild moment we are living through, is just the right time to move forward with the hope of the Gospel by planting a church!

And that's why we're here, asking you to partner with us!

WHEN WILL WE START:Our plans are to launch our first Online Service September 13th with open Home Churches launching later in the Fall (as safety permits).

WHO ARE WE:We are a diverse group of 18 adults that are being sent out and supported by The Movement Church in East Oakland (led by Pastor Edward Paz). We've spent the last 12-15 months together gathering to pray, dream, plan, study and serve - all for the goal of starting a new church that would be able to reach and love the people around us! And here we are, in what seems like a new world, but with the same clear call - to love God, love our neighbors and help people follow Jesus.



 WHAT WILL WE DO:

Great question. We haven't found a manual on how to start a new church in the midst of a Global Pandemic (let us know if you stumble upon one). Because there are a lot of unknowns in this season, we are sticking close to the basics. 1. Teach through the Bible in an engaging online weekly service.2. Launch Home Churches where everyone can use their gifts to flourish.3. Engage Skeptics by creating safe spaces to explore faith (Alpha ).WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR:

Faith,Help Elena Pay Stdnt Debt to Enter Religious Life,"Roseburg, OR",23245.0,26195.0,178,36,76,"The call: To give of myself totally, freely, and joyfully to Jesus Christ by consecrating myself to Him. I desire to be fully His and undivided. I desire to proclaim with my whole life the freedom in Christ which is offered to all and which heals all.The obstacle: $103,000 in student loansThe story: Raised Catholic in a loving family, my eyes were opened to a greater depth of love in my freshman year at Oregon State University when I first encountered the Saint John Society and Society of Mary, missionary religious orders originally from Argentina. During my four years at OSU, I continued to seek a deeper faith in Christ through prayer and service while studying for my undergraduate degree. Since I was little, I have felt the need to try to alleviate the suffering of those around me.  As a I grew older, this need allowed me to see my future as a nurse. After my four years at OSU, I moved to Portland, Oregon to pursue this dream and I graduated with my BSN in August of 2018. After working as an RN for some time, I began to experience a need for something more. I would come home from my shifts, pray, and experience the most subtle sadness.  This sadness confused me because my job was even better than I thought it would be. I loved nursing even more than I thought I would, and even with that, I felt a small sadness. Fast forward some months, I took a trip to walk the Camino de Santiago and to visit Fatima and Rome. I felt a new freedom to abandon my will and repose it in the will of my Father. With this freedom, I opened my heart to listen to the Lord in regards to my vocation. Up until this point, I had always believed I had found my vocation: to be a wife, mother, and nurse. Slowly, the Lord began to change these desires and opened my eyes to the way of life that most makes me alive and utilizes my talents. I began to discern the religious life with the Society of Mary - the group of sisters who evangelized me at 18. Since I began my discernment, I have experienced fulfillment as I had never experienced before. I have more joy, excitement, and love as I look at my life through the vision of this vocation. It is as if every aspect of my life, all the joy and suffering, makes sense in light of this call. This desire, to give of myself completely, totally, fully, and undivided to Jesus Christ and to my brothers and sisters in Him, has always been the root desire in me. As I move forward and answer the Lord with a ""yes"" to the call to be consecrated to Him, I see that the Lord also calls me to retain the most fundamental aspects of nursing and to bring them with me into this new life. As a sister in the Society of Mary, my joy will be to proclaim the healing medicine of Christ, freedom in Him, and Him as the true source of abundant life and hope. How you can help: First and foremost, I humbly ask for your prayers. I have entrusted this obstacle to the intercession of St. Joseph, and with joy, I accept the will of the Father for me. Second, if you feel called and can support me financially, I am heartily grateful. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have, or if you would like to hear more about my story!"

Let's get this family to Canada!As you may know, the media has done very little to report on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, which has resulted in more than 3 million people fleeing for their lives. Many of these are wonderful, safe, friendly people who are taking refuge in Jordan as they seek asylum in a safe country. And sadly, America is accepting only a tiny number refugees for resettlement.Many of us are terribly frustrated about this situation, and are forced to look for other alternatives to help our displaced friends. That's why I am asking for you to join me to help a dear Iraqi refugee family start a new life in Canada!Thankfully, Canada still allows private sponsorship for resettlement of refugee families.  The family that this GoFundMe campaign will help has been accepted for sponsorship by a church in Ottawa. The church needs the first year expenses for this family to be raised before the Canadian government will allow them to emigrate. That amount for this family of four is $40,000 (US dollars), we already have $10,000 fundraised. 100% of the money raised will go to this sponsorship, allowing them to leave Jordan and start a new life in Canada. North Pointe Baptist Church is accepting all donations for this family.This amazing family (father, mother, 9-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter) fled from Iraq because of the unspeakable violence and religious persecution they endured. They are currently in Jordan, where they have been waiting for more than three years for a country to accept them. They cannot stay in Jordan. Laws prohibit them from working and their kids are not able to go to public school. There is no future for them here, and they cannot safely return to Iraq.I am unable to put their names or photo on this page for security reasons. They still have family in Iraq and they fear retaliation against them. When they are safely in Canada you will receive a full report with their story of life in Iraq along with photos and an update on their trip to freedom.Please help this family begin a new life. Any donation will help, but please be as generous as possible! Our goal is big, but I know your heart is even bigger!"

Faith,Save Our Seminarians Fund,"Staten Island, NY",21800.0,250000.0,154,254,656,"From six years of age, my dream was to become a Catholic priest. I dedicated over twenty years of my life to serving the Church, and those who have known me supported this call. I began my studies for priesthood in the Archdiocese of New York, and Cardinal Dolan nominated me to continue my studies at the Pontifical North American College (NAC) in Rome. There I met with continued achievement as a top-student with accolades from the Cardinal, faculty, and peers.While at the NAC, I witnessed inappropriate physical behavior committed by the vice-rector, Father Adam Park, toward a seminarian. The seminarian later divulged to me that Father Park made other physical contact described as “hurtful.” My concern for my classmates’ safety was only heightened as I received additional reports alleging inappropriate behaviors by the vice-rector, urging for an investigation into these behaviors, and even citing an instance of a seminarian “crying out for help.”In October of 2018, I was told by physicians that I needed to return to New York for urgent surgery. I obtained permissions for a brief six-week leave which Cardinal Dolan approved in writing, and I continued all of my studies during my recovery. Five days before I was to return to the NAC, the Cardinal informed me that the NAC rector, Father Peter Harman, was blocking my return on the basis of fabricated claims against my “permission documentation” and formation easily disprovable by evidence. I requested on five occasions a meeting with the Cardinal which he denied me. It became apparent that he wanted neither to allow me to present my documentation refuting the false statements against me, nor to receive evidence of Father Park’s alleged misconduct. In good faith, I could not be complicit with what I believed was a cover-up of what I knew of the vice-rector, and I could do no other than resign under duress as a seminarian. Were it not for Cardinal Dolan’s handwritten food-stained letter sealing his refusal to grant me an impartial interview, I would have been ordained a deacon this year and soon after a priest.Unfortunately, I am only one of hundreds of seminarians documented to have been retaliated against over the past twenty years for exposing clerical misconduct taking place in seminaries. This situation has led to a dramatic decrease in priestly ordinations which in just one year recently declined by 27 percent.Amid pleas for help by NAC seminarians, many supporters and I reported my case to every level of the Church hierarchy for over a year-and-a-half imploring that I be given a chance to present my evidence, clear my name, and have an investigation opened into Father Park’s alleged misconduct. While Fathers Harman and Park to this day remain in their roles exerting control over vulnerable NAC seminarians, my reports have gone unaddressed, depriving me of justice from a Church I so faithfully served. The apparent cover-up taking place validates what many have told me: culpable Church leaders will listen to my case only when faced with a lawsuit. Having exhausted all options to resolve my case in the Church, I now prepare to take legal action. Professionals are confident I have a strong case given the copious evidence I possess. As my lawyer prepares to file suit, I realize that those to be held accountable have massive financial resources only bolstered by their many appeals for donations. For this reason, I ask your support that will allow my legal case to move forward and uphold my efforts to raise awareness so that no seminarian should have to suffer as I have. My case is not the first involving the victimization of seminarians, but with your help, I hope that it may be the last.I also invite you to learn more and stay updated about this case by following and sharing the blog “Save our Seminarians"": saveourseminarians.wordpress.com May good men and women take this chance to stand up for what is right, so that silence may no longer yield new generations of victims.

I am writing to you with the hope that you might be able to help. There is currently an undergoing project of a church being built in a city near Nebelet, Ethiopia. It’s in a very rural area out in the countryside. The project has been delayed countless times due to a few reasons. The first being, people in this area live in extreme poverty and do not have the means to donate money to the church. The second being, there is equipment and materials that are needed to build a well-built church with a strong base foundation. There has been no support from outside sources to help complete this. When I heard about this, I knew I had to figure out a way to be a service to others. Since this is a big project, I know that it will take a team of people to bring it to life. As Orthodox, we understand the importance of a church and being able to have a place of worship. With all of your donations, the church will be built without any delays. There will be updates on the progress of this church through videos and photos to show you how your contribution is making a difference.  Thank you all in advance! “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” - Matthew 16:18In Christ,Brhan Woldu"

Faith,300 Horsepower 300 Lives,"Ooltewah, TN",21600.0,38000.0,115,28,495,"My name is Sean Knapp and I have been serving as a Missionary/Medevac pilot in the Philippines for over seven years. I didn't come here specifically to provide a Air Ambulance service, but upon arriving here we quickly saw the daily, needless loss of life on many of the remote islands around us all because of a lack of transportation. The boats that are available can cost the patient's family up to 50,000p ($1000) to hire, but they are slow and when the waves get big they have to let the patient suffer and die in the clinic since the boats can't go.     Now PAMAS has one helicopter and two airplanes on the island of Palawan making hundreds of medevac flights each year. Our services are free to the indigent and all others just pay for our fuel if they can. I absolutely love this work! The people here deserve this service and we are happy to provide it for them!    At the heart of our small fleet of aircraft is a Cessna U206F. Despite having only one engine it is the perfect air ambulance for us. In May of 2017 we overhauled the engine and since then it has flown almost 300 medevac flights! The shortest of these flights is 2 hrs, but many of these flights are from 4-7 hrs.    This brings me to the heart of my appeal for help. This engine is about to time out and EVERY TIME this has happened our aircraft go out of service for at least SIX months! We have to wait for parts to be shipped to and from the States and as a pilot I dread this because we have no other aircraft that can continue serving the people and this means going back to the uncalled for loss of life.   Are you willing to partner together with us in order to keep these life saving, air ambulance services accessible to the people of this region of the Philippines? Would you please join us as volunteer pilots and medical staff here who are constantly risking our lives to show these people that in God's eyes they are highly valued? If so please help us reach our goal of at least $38,000.    This money will used to purchase a complete engine, ship it to the Philippines and probably be enough to overhaul our existing propeller. From the one who see's these patients almost every day and who constantly hears their health care providers telling us of how much they praise God for our services, I want to say THANK YOU very much for your help!"
Faith,Preserving Bhakti Tirtha Swami's house,"Milwaukee, WI",20332.0,87190.0,179,120,248,"Dear devotees, followers, and friends of Bhakti Tirtha Swami,
 
Please accept our humble obeisances.  All glories to Srila Prabhupada!  All glories to Guru and Gauranga!
 
2020 is a milestone year in so many ways.  It would have been Srila Bhakti Tirtha Swami’s 70th birthday and this month of June marks the 15th Anniversary of His Holiness’ disappearance. As an offering to Bhakti Tirtha Swami to commemorate these auspicious occasions we would like to humbly invite you to join a global initiative to raise funds to clear the mortgage balance on Gurudeva’s Gita Nagari Institute House and preserve His Holiness’ legacy for future generations.

This house is where Gurudeva wrote many of his books, performed his transcendental final pastimes and departed this world. As per his wishes, this is where Maharaja’s personal items and paraphernalia are maintained and displayed, where we host sannyasis and senior Prabhupada disciples, continue to have devotional activities and where the stewards Vrajalila & Ekavira reside. Krsna has given us this wonderful opportunity to come together as an international family to finally secure this building.

We’ve had many challenges with the property over the years, and we are now facing one of the most urgent.  Two years ago we were successful in getting the title deed transferred to the Institute, but we did not refinance so the existing mortgage is not in IFAST’s name. The lender has now decided to call the loan, which requires us to either refinance, pay off the balance or risk foreclosure. After considering all the options and seeking guidance from Bhakti Tirtha Swami’s close Godbrothers, we have realized that this is a wonderful opportunity to pull together as the family and community that Bhakti Tirtha Swami saw us to be, and show our love and appreciation for the amazing personality who touched, and still touches, all our lives.  
 
We know it’s a difficult economic time for so many, but we feel encouraged and enthusiastic at this chance to let Krishna work his magic through all of us on behalf of his dedicated servant.  
 
The payoff amount is $87,000, and our deadline is June 27th 2020 to commemorate Gurudeva’s departure date.  By Guru’s and Krishna’s mercy, several devotees have already pledged $45,000.   If all of us give what we can  - no amount is too small and every offering is meaningful – we know that we can reach the goal and secure this property for once and for all.  
 
We are all blessed by the best! Please make your contribution to our joint offering by clicking on the GoFundMe link, and feel free to spread the word.  Remember, no amount is too small to honor Maharaja’s life, preaching and commitment in service of Srila Prabhupada’s vision.

Faith,AIM AIR - Beyond 45,"Peachtree City, GA",58571.0,100000.0,71,143,1.3K,"Friends - Thank You for your generous giving! We have now concluded Beyond 45 through GoFundMe. Please see our update below. If you would like to receive future updates and stories from AIM AIR, please Sign Up here. ----------------------------------------This year COVID-19 took a toll on AIM AIR. Our normal flight schedule dropped to half of our budgeted amount, resulting in losses of about $25,000 per month. Despite financial reserves that initially offset our monthly losses, we are projecting a $100,000 shortfall in our Operations Fund by the end of the year.Established 45 years ago in 1975, AIM AIR has been using aviation in East and Central Africa to help missionaries and the local church go beyond the end of the road. Many Africa Inland Mission (AIM) missionaries serve in extremely isolated, remote, and often insecure areas among people that have little exposure to, or understanding of, the Good News. Using aircraft has allowed us to keep missionary communities connected to the rest of the world.When we look “Beyond 45” years of ministry we believe God will continue to have a purpose for AIM AIR. There is still a need for safe and reliable aviation support within AIM and the church in East and Central Africa. We have the tools and desire to offer our support as a lifeline to those living in remote and isolated areas for years to come.We need your help. The “Beyond 45"" campaign will ensure the survival of AIM AIR. As the 2020 shortfall is met we are eager to begin reducing our flight costs to AIM missionaries – now more isolated than ever because of COVID travel restrictions. Funds will then transition to covering some of the fixed costs of AIM AIR, significantly lowering the cost of our flights into the future.While Beyond 45 is primarily about outlasting this pandemic, we hope you also see it as the beginning of a new opportunity to better support missionaries and the church in East and Central Africa. Let’s go Beyond 45 together and see what God has planned.Will you go Beyond 45 with us and be a lifeline?All funds given to AIM through this GoFundMe campaign will go towards the AIM AIR Operations fund - a project of Africa Inland Mission. Interested in giving by check or other means or becoming a monthly investor?

Faith,Let's Build Pastor.com,"Sarasota, FL",20428.0,100000.0,188,303,131,"It is time to build a social media app so Pastors can communicate to all of their church members!My name is Brett Blair. I own Sermons.com (Dynamic Preaching) which has provided resources for clergy around the world for 25 years. I was born in Memphis, Tennessee and now live in Sarasota, Florida with my wife and 3 children. Here I create resources to help churches tell the story of our Lord and Savior and now I want to give you a chance to participate in the development of a new resource. A social media platform for pastors and churches: Pastor.comThe secular media is now routinely shutting down speech and the big tech firms who own all the viable social media platforms do the same, or at least they throttle the ability of you the pastor to reach your congregation. It is our desire to give churches and their leaders the ability to speak to all their members instantly and to have those messages delivered to all the intended targets. If a pastor has 5000 members and needs to reach all those members with an update or message then every one of them should get that communication. Currently a fraction of the intended recipients would ever see a post on big platforms like Twitter and Facebook. We will start building Pastor.com in December of this year - 2020. I want to give a select group of pastors and/or church leaders the chance to participate in this project. Any amount is appreciated: $10, $20, or $30. But, for pastors who participate, giving $100 or more, they will be given the following:     1. A two year membership to Sermons.com, a $180 value, provided you are not currently a member and have never been a member.     2. Login access to Pastor.com as we build it so you can see how projects like this progress.     3. The ability to suggest directions for development. We will always respond to these.     4. First choice on ""your_name @ pastor.com"" (spaces added) forwarding email address. Currently none exist so first names are available.     5. Five years of free access to all levels of Pastor.com. The platform will be free to use like all other social media apps but if we create paid levels you will have free and full access.     6. A permanent mention as a founding member of the site. Published publicly on the Honorary Members page. This page will be a limited list recording your participation and no one else.     7. Laypersons can gift the 2 year Sermons.com membership to their pastor ― after the $100 or more contribution ― and they will become a founding member with all the benefits above.Your support means a lot to me. I know how hard pastors work. Having been a United Methodist pastor for 30 years, I also know how little they get paid. After seminary, and with $42,000 of student loan debt, I was placed in a three-point charge making $17,000 a year. So, I don't take your financial contribution for granted. It means the world to me and I want to give you as much as I can for your help.Now, let's build an app that will work for you. That will work for the church. That will give us peace of mind knowing dependable social media correspondence with all our members is happening at the push of a button. Please contribute today.Grace and Peace,Brett"
Faith,Help Me Get to Carmel!,"Farmville, VA",28680.0,27000.0,106,161,368,"Praised be Jesus Christ! My beloved invited me to be His Bride and specifically to be His Carmelite Bride. I am beyond excited to accept this call and to continue on this adventure with Him. With this invitation comes RADICAL trust, which is both humbling and crazy. I have complete faith that He will continue to show me His Divine Providence and help me to answer this call so that more souls will come to know Him. I am confident that through YOUR help, generosity and prayers that I will be able to live in freedom by being debt free from my student loans. This freedom will allow me to be fully present as a Candidate with the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles. https://carmelitesistersocd.com/ 



November 2013, I gave my life to Christ in the Chapel at The College of William and Mary. I knew that I was meant for something more. I had no idea what it was, but I knew that God was calling me higher. He was calling me more than solely the mediocre life that I was living for Him in college.  After a challenging breakup, I quickly realized that I did not have many friends, but had a great desire to keep growing in my faith. Through this realization and sudden abundance of time, I started praying daily in the Catholic Campus Ministry (CCM) Chapel. These short minutes of prayer aching for the Lord to ease my pain turned into 10 minutes, which turned into 30 minutes, which eventually led to daily Holy Hours as a missionary with FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students).  


God took my incredibly tiny minuscule 'yes' and ran with it. He softened my heart for 7 years and romanced me like no one ever has. He constantly met me where I was. He made invitations to serve Him in Alabama, Florida, Texas and back home in Virginia.  He provided for me then, and I know that He is providing for me now.  I accumulated $29,000 in student loans graduating from The College of William and Mary, and I need to be debt-free in order to move on from Candidacy to Postulancy if that is God's call for me. Any additional funds raised, will go towards my dowry, which will ensure that I will have health insurance during my formation in Postulancy and the Novitiate. 


I have absolutely loved my time in Candidacy with the Carmelites, but would love to live in complete freedom for the remainder of the year. Please prayerfully consider to support me in this journey through your spiritual and financial support.  God can never be outdone in generosity. Thank you in advance and know of my prayers! If you have any comments, prayer intentions, or questions, then please let me know!"
Faith,Pastor Dale Meador's Journey with ALS,"Carlsbad, CA",18880.0,15000.0,92,108,447,"Pastor Dale Meador has helped the lives of countless people in countless ways. As Nancy and Dale begin the journey of navigating his ALS, his friends are reaching out and creating this campaign to help Dale, Nancy and the rest of his family not worry about day to day life, and focus on the time they have together. So this is our opportunity to express our love and support to Dale and Nancy for their decades of  dedication and ministry to serving others. One of the first projects we can help them with is a renovation of their front and back yards to remove the unruly lawns and make the landscape as free of maintenance as possible so theirs will be a comfortable home for Nancy going forward. She will have her hands full with the Airbnb, a good source of security for her future. As we identify other needs we will keep you all updated.  Let us help them be unburdened by trivial things in life, to focus on family before the next chapter comes. Below are the words of Pastor Dale to better explain where his health is at and his discovery of ALS. Thanks so much for your support - Bruce Moon----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don’t remember when it started. I just remember, for the first time ever, having to think about my breathing while I was preaching. It was a strain: I had to consciously pull in air in order to have enough to keep speaking, especially when emphasizing a point. I don’t remember when it started, but I know when I can hear it. When I went back and listened to recordings of my preaching, I could hear the difference between the messages of February 2 and February 9.  On February 2, I sounded normal, and reasonably strong. On February 9, strained and wheezy.This began a period of attention to my voice. I thought perhaps that three recent surgeries (prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and a hernia) and the tube they run down your throat for them might have damaged me somehow. But a scope of my throat by an ENT came up negative.  I began speech therapy and eventually wound up at the pulmonologist’s office. He’s the lung guy, and the tests they gave me showed pretty quickly that it wasn’t a lung issue: it’s the muscles that help to operate the lungs. The tests pointed to a muscular degenerative disease.Our daughter-in-love Rebecca had also visited a pulmonologist recently. With most of the remains of her brain tumor removed shortly after she gave birth to our Princess Peanut - my pet name for Caroline - Rebecca is always vigilant for symptoms that might show that the tumor is growing or moving. She had some of the same tests I was eventually given. Thankfully, she checked out okay. But because of Rebecca’s tests Nancy was looking at that information when she came across the information for ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. As Nancy read, she realized that I checked all the boxes for that, and had for some time without realizing it.So our visit with the pulmonologist and a subsequent visit to a neurologist have all but confirmed a diagnosis of ALS for me. I have to have another test before it can be said to be certain, but the neuro Doc said it’s basically a done deal.This comes as a surprise, and a little scary. If you look at a reputable website, the fifth and sixth sentences say something like, “There is no cure for this disease” and “ALS will eventually rob you of moving, breathing, swallowing and talking.”  Man.  I don’t know about you, but moving, breathing, swallowing and talking have been four of my favorite hobbies.So we are sitting here, digesting this news. I awaken in the middle of the night, thinking of a million little things that need to be done or arranged. Little things like: “Will Nancy know how to remove the battery cover on the smoke alarm without breaking off that little tab?” and big things like, “How can she stay in this house?” We’ve just begun to think about all this, but most of my initial concern relates to setting up Nancy. Immediately, our kids have stepped up and told me not to worry about all this, but you all know how much better it will be if she can live independent of much of their time and concern.Anyway, all that is premature and I know that the Lord will provide. When I shared the news with our Elders they immediately assured me that I don’t need to worry about such future things. And I know that’s true: our Church Family has always been so very very very kind to us, through the ups and downs of life together for over 20 years. Still, many questions weigh on us just now; Nancy, me, and our kids are all processing this.Some of you know what this is like: you too are wrestling with such end-of-life questions, or have. You or a loved one have received a similar diagnosis, or one from the same family of bad diagnoses.  God love you: I just got another heapin’ helping of empathy for what you are going through, or what you went through.Mainly what I wanted to share was this: Isn’t it wonderful that on the first Sunday I should preach with the expectation that I had ALS that I would preach that section of John 8 that included these precious words from our Lord Jesus: “Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”After the message, several people reached out to me to say that it was helpful to be challenged to be ready to trust Jesus not only in life, but in death.  One couple shared that it would have been so helpful, at the death of her sister, if they could have spoken in plain terms about death and resurrection and gospel hope but instead the atmosphere was mute since some of their loved ones couldn't bear to deal with death squarely. Another person, a widow, told me in tears that the loss of her husband has been hard, but would have been 10x harder if she didn’t have the hope of life after death, and the hope that indeed true disciples will never “see” or “taste” death. Personally, in God’s providence that text could not have been better timed.On top of that, Beaux’s comprehensive message this morning was the perfect follow-up for anyone looking for real comfort in the face of suffering, which only find meaning and purpose in the Lord!Nancy and I delivered a rental truck full of Family Retreat supplies to Twin Rocks for the upcoming Joni and Friends Family Retreats there. Normally, we would stay and serve for the two weeks, but this year it seemed best to drop out weeks back. That was a hard decision: most of you know how important that ministry has been to us over the years, and how much we love the families affected by disability served through it. Now that decision has proved to be best: it’s best that we don’t serve this year. Instead, we dropped the truck and then drove from the camp without speaking to anyone (to keep the camp COVID-safe) and went across the street to the beach.  There, we wept, knowing it is unlikely I will serve there again. My head is swimming; Nancy is overwhelmed. But last night I made a statement akin to: “This is an opportunity to prove what I’ve been preaching” or words to that effect. That could sound like, “Now I’ve got to do my part in dying well, Jesus having done his part for me already.” That’s not what I mean, or not what i should mean. Frankly, I don’t know if I can die well: when I read about the progression of ALS, it scares me. So honestly I know I can’t do it.  And so instead I should say this: “I’ve trusted in the Lord all these years, and now I’m going to have to trust him in a new important way, that his strength be shown in my encroaching weakness.”  It’s important that he be glorified, and not that I am said to be courageous or strong.  That should be easy: right now I feel anything but that!  Again, I love you and your families and thank you for your role in our family and church family.”Thank you for your love and concern for Nancy and me and our family. While I don’t see any interruption of my role in the ministry to which I was called, I would ask you to please pray that the Lord would give us and BCC’s Elders wisdom for the decisions that lay ahead, and confidence in him in the face of all uncertainty.- Pastor Dale"

Faith,Camp Barakel Fund for maintenance building fire,"Fairview, MI",17600.0,20000.0,130,134,1.6K,"Sometime Friday night our main maintenance building caught fire. The burning remains were discovered at 5:30 July 18, 2020. It is a total loss, and one that will take a long time to recover from. This building housed all of our equipment and supplies for carpentry, plumbing, electrical, heating, metal fabrication, painting, sign-making, and groundskeeping.We thank and praise God that no one was killed or injured, and that the fire did not spread to our Bus Shelter, Vehicle Garage, Equipment Shed, Firewood Shed, Program Storage Barn, or (and especially) ignite our storage of diesel fuel, gasoline, or the two LP gas tanks that served that building.We also lost one large stationary generator that serviced the entire maintenance area, three pickup trucks, one diesel chore tractor (the larger blue Ford), our Sky-Trak telescoping forklift, a Chevy Suburban, a Toyota mini-van, and a golf cart. We have not even begun to comprehend the size of the loss of tools such as table saws, leaf rakes, snow shovels, sanders, air compressors and nail guns, spare lightbulbs, new toilets, floor paint, and everything else needed for a well-maintained camp (including numerous personally-owned tools). We keep a large store of all sorts of tools for when big groups of volunteers come to help.We appreciate your prayers for us as we assess the damage, begin the cleanup, and make plans for a new maintenance building. We did have some content insurance, and a few of the vehicles had individual insurance policies, but this is a significant loss nonetheless. However, God is unchanged and we rest in Him as we labor."

For the past 7 years, SEAIC has been running social and religious events successfully without a place of our own.  guest speakers, potluck, family quiz nights,  200 lunches for our Nurses and Medical Staff during COVID-19 lockdown, without having a physical masjid.  

We have an opportunity to buy a beautiful piece of land for our community after 7 years.   Alhamdulillah the land is in the heart of our community. The cost of land is a little over 1 million USD, Alhamdulillah we have half of it covered and inviting the community for an opportunity to participate in the Sadaqa Al-Jariya (Continuous Charity, which increases reward even after we are no longer in the world). 

There can be no better time to give Sadaqa Jariya than Ramadan where every good deed is multiplied manifolds. Please come forward and have the honor of building a Masjid, for us and more importantly for our future generation.

The present viral climate we live in is all too real for us all. It has impacted all aspects of what we felt was a sound way of life. As the beginning of my introduction states, I am a Front Line Healthcare worker caring directly for the highest level of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The picture you see is of my own personal Respirator with 100 rated filtration filters as well as my own face shield. I am one of the fortunate ones, actually the only one at my facility, to have this equipment. This level of PPE is needed and well documented in every part of the world and what our GOV is using when coming in contact with COVID-19 settings. My background and hobbies had these items laying around for automotive and home improvement needs. The 1x N95 use for entire 12-14 hour shift in this high viral environment is not safe practice and losing one of my fellow ICU Team members: RN/Physician/RT to  sickness or worse means not only the loss of a front line healthcare worker but the lives of patients they could have cared for during this pandemic. My Mission Field is to provide the same, APPROPRIATE, 100 grade filtration level of respiratory and visual protection to my COVID-19 ICU Team and I pray if this provides the means, to other COVID ICU, ED, & Paramedics Front Line Healthcare Members across DFW. I have acquired all the proper information and what is needed to set up each of these Front Line workers with the PPE that will not only ease anxiety, stress, fear, but Above All: Allow us to care for these patients with our undivided attention Safely. I humbly-sincerely ask you all to please contribute what you can to this worthy cause. I assure you every dollar given will be spent on reusable PPE equipment to help my fellow Critical Care Healthcare Workers in fighting this battle until it is won. If you cannot contribute as this time, I ask for your prayers. I pray you all are safe, healthy, and life returns to what we knew it to be sooner than later. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Faith,Brooks Church Coffee Trailer - LINC San Antonio,"San Antonio, TX",54207.0,60000.0,142,41,204,"Did you know there are no Christian churches meeting or serving in the 78235 zip code? Brooks City Base is ready for its own church. This fall, Brooks Church will begin to worship and serve the community. Brooks Church is a new church plant in the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. Our mission is building up disciples who follow Jesus, are being shaped by Jesus, and serve as Jesus. Did you also know, on average, it takes north of $250,000 to get a new church up and running? In today's economy, that may seem like an insurmountable sum of money. Most new church plants are supported by a 'sending congregation', meaning a well-established church provides funds and charter members to help get things going and engage the community. Brooks Church was conceived by a mission organization with modest means and no ""members"", so we looked to alternate solutions for both financial capital and community engagement.Enter Brooks Coffee. Also lacking in the 78235 zip code? Quick-serve coffee options! There is currently one Starbucks at Brooks City Base, and if you've ever driven by, you've seen the line wrapped around the building, no matter the day or time. We're bringing a solution to this problem with a new food truck-style coffee shop. Being mobile in nature will allow us to bring locally-sourced coffee to the community, thus generating the profit needed to launch our new congregation, while also spreading the word about Brooks Church, and serving potential new members from within the community. Naturally, starting a coffee truck isn't free! This is where you come in. Remember that $250,000 figure we mentioned earlier? To begin our new venture will take roughly $60,000 total. While this is a mere fraction of typical starting costs, it is still no small feat, and we need your help!You can choose to donate a set dollar amount, or to sponsor a specific piece of equipment or materials (estimated costs listed below). Any donation, large or small, will bring us one step closer to launching a sustainable ministry at Brooks Church, and laying the foundation for a church planting movement. ***As we reach milestones, we will check off the items below that you are helping us pay for!***Thank you for your generosity!Items Needed:✅Food trailer: $17,806Used truck: $14,999Espresso machine: $4,6497,000-watt generator: $4,500Consultant fees: $2,000Miscellaneous/incidentals: $2,000 Commercial coffee grinder: $1,439Commercial Drip Coffee Brewer: $1,439Initial product inventory (first month's coffee beans, cups, etc.): $1,250Merchandise + uniforms: $1,250Marketing + website: $1,200Coolers: $1000""Cash register"" (POS system): $950 Permits + licenses: $500 Fire extinguisher: $300Two smaller bean grinders: $280Pitcher rinser: $100Storage Containers: $100""Dorm"" fridge: $70 Hot Plates: $60Digital scale: $50"

Faith,Mission Critical Vehicle for Sarmiento Family,"Sandy, UT",15000.0,15000.0,143,52,164,"After a couple decades of ministry and life in Honduras Jairo and Lourdes Sarmiento, following the call of God on their lives, moved their family from Tegucigalpa, Honduras to San Jose, California in 2013.  This move meant literally starting over in ministry and material possessions, but this sort of sacrifice is nothing new to this family as they have always given more than they have and personally sacrifice their needs for the benefit of others.  As they began their lives in San Jose, CA they partnered with The River Church to reach Latino families.  They were provided a home to live in, a vehicle to drive and many basic items to set up their home through the generosity of the church and friends.  These past seven years have not been easy as they have awaited proper immigration status from the United States, fundraise to provide income for their family and serve the community that they live in.  A little over five years ago Jairo and Lourdes founded Shalom Iglesia Church.Under their leadership the church continues to grow, serve their community and impact hundreds of lives! Jairo provides pastoral services to the members of the church; Lourdes serves the women and children of the church while Joselyn and Aaron (their two children) serve the youth and help lead worship.  However, the Sarmientos go beyond just leading the church and have become a foundational part of the community they live in.  They develop leaders, partner with local organizations to provide legal assistance, offer psychological counseling to the community, seek to provide resources for single mothers and much more.Throughout this time the Sarmientos have utilized a 2000 minivan with 300,000 miles on it.  This van not only provides transportation for their family but is regularly used to assist community and church members to get back and forth to doctor visits, family, groceries and more.  About three weeks ago, while driving down the road, the van finally died on them.  This has left them without the means to do much of the ministry they normally provide to the community.  This brings me to the purpose of the fundraiser.  I would like to see the Sarmiento family blessed with a “new to them” vehicle that will provide years of solid and safe transportation and the ability to move the ministry forward by the of the Summer.  Would you consider being part of this gift to the Sarmiento family?  If you can donate funds, thank you!  If you would consider sharing this fundraiser with others, thank you! In closing I leave you with a message from the Sarmiento’s themselves. “During these years of mission here in the USA we have experienced moments of solitude, far from home, old friends, family, home church, the security of the known. In the Bible we see that many experienced the same thing: Adam, Noah, Moses, Abram, Jacob, Elijah, David, Job, Paul, John etc. And it is that missional work itself has implications such as loneliness, however, always accompanied by the One who calls us to such a mission, the Lord, who is always faithful in the midst of our solitudes and of course each and every one of you who faithfully accompany us in this work of extending the Kingdom of God through your prayers, letters, visits, finances, questions, etc. Our deep gratitude for all of you who remind us that 'WE ARE NOT ALONE'. “"

Jared is survived by his wife, Nikita, and two young children, Connor, age 3, and Abel, age 6.What seemed to be just another Sunday turned out to be the day that would change all of our lives forever more. On Sunday, August 23rd, my beloved brother, Jared, was tragically killed in a workplace accident. Receiving the news that Jared was gone, was devasting and heartbreaking for our entire family, especially Nikita and the boys.  Jared was a hard working family man. He lived for Nikita, Connor and Abel; nothing came before them. He was a devoted husband and father, always making every day fun and special for them. Jared enjoyed his job, but more importantly he loved his co-workers and they loved and appreciated him too. Jared will be remembered for his contagious smile and laugh. He was a generous, kind, respectful young man.We are asking for donations to help contribute towards Connor and Abel’s postsecondary education and provide allowance for other family expenses. All proceeds will go directly to Nikita, Connor and Abel. Any amount is greatly appreciated as they continue the mourning and grieving process due to the loss of Jared.On behalf of Nikita, Connor and Abel, their closest friends and the entire family, I appreciate the outpouring of love, prayers, and support shown over the past couple of weeks and undoubtedly, in the months and years to come.The Aleris/Novelis family will match the first $100,000.00  donated."

In addition to losing a loving husband and devoted father, Megan and the kids have also lost significant financial resources. Unfortunately, although Pete had limited life insurance, it is woefully insufficient to provide Elsie, Cora, and Christopher the rich childhood, overflowing with sports, arts, music, and adventure, that Megan and Pete always intended.To that end, we are seeking donations to help Megan defray existing and increased childcare costs that she will now have to bear without Pete.  Everyone who crossed paths with Pete, whether in Cheshire, at Yale or Michigan, or in San Diego, knows that he was an absolutely remarkable man.  Michigan Law School grad.  Captain of the 2000 Yale Football Team.  First Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego.  Partner at Jones Day. More importantly, he was a caring son and brother, a loving husband, and a devoted father.  In addition to all that, he was the most faithful of friends.  Pete's obituary, which can be found here , is a beautiful tribute that more fully describes Pete's amazing life.  And Megan has established an email account, [email redacted], so that we can all share stories, notes, photos, and more with Elsie, Cora, and Christopher about their incredible dad now and over the years.Throughout the years, Pete, Megan, and their family have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with so many of us – their family, friends, teammates, and colleagues - through times good and bad.  Now, in these most trying times, we have the chance to provide Pete’s family with that same support and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Megan and their kids now and in the coming days.Thank you all so very much in advance as we come together to help Megan and her family during this unimaginable time.   Friends of Pete"

Tracy fought a courageous battle over the past four months and passed away peacefully this morning.  Tracy’s four children Kimberly (23), Patrick (20), KellyAnn (18) & James (11) have been continuously at her side. To know Tracy was to love her and she was loved by so many.  She was a wonderful wife, mother, daughter, sister & friend.  She had the biggest heart and was always the first to lend a helping hand, be a listening ear, or shoulder to cry on.  She touched so many lives with her kindness, huge generosity, and caring spirit.  She found such pleasure in being surrounded by those she loved and having everyone gather together at her home.  Tracy's greatest passion & accomplishment in life was being a mom.  She loved her children more than anything and would do anything for them.  Having suffered such hardship when they lost their father, she always wanted to protect them and would do everything she could to fill their lives with happiness & joy.  There was never a game, social event or school gathering that she did participate in (and often organized) and could always be heard cheering the loudest, telling a story or laughing with everyone.  With her incredible support system in her family, friends, neighbors and colleagues, she now needs our help to ease any burden off her children as they mourn their mother.  They will need us more than ever now.  It is truly impossible to express how much she meant to all of us and how profoundly she will be missed. Please help us to keep her memory eternal.  A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to support the educational costs for Tracy’s children along with financial support. She now joins her love Jimmy, with whom she had an intensely special and strong connection.  They had a type of love that we all hope to experience in our lives."

Family,Help Lucas Gourley Battle Leukemia (AML),"New York, NY",93652.0,250000.0,107,371,1.2K,"Hello and welcome to Team Lucas! Lucas is fighting for his life and needs your help.Lucas is a six-year-old CANCER WARRIOR who lives in Austin, Texas with his parents, big brother Jack (9), and little sister Dylan (4 and a future hero). He is a sports fanatic and a die-hard Boston sports fan (thanks to his mom Erin). He can be found cheering on the Red Sox and Celtics any chance he can as well as his parents’ alumni, the Texas Longhorns.On July 31st, 2020, Lucas was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). AML is a RARE cancer, affecting less that 500 children per year in the United States. Lucas immediately underwent a first round of chemotherapy that was unsuccessful in eradicating the cancer cells from his bones. At the end of 28 days of chemo, 60% cancer still remained. Round two called for a more aggressive and intense plan. It involved targeted FLT3 drugs and adult level chemotherapy that have only been used in trials with some children. They are currently evaluating the effect of this treatment and we are keeping our fingers crossed.With AML the white blood cells produced in Lucas's bone marrow are abnormal and do not become healthy cells. These abnormal cells are unable to fight off infection and can be life threatening. Not only is AML exceptionally rare in children, but the mutations of Lucas's cancer are even more rare and unique (FLT3 Non-ITD N676K - less than 20 adolescent cases per year). All pediatric cancers are considered rare and therefore underfunded, under researched, and information about these cases isn't widely shared nor publicized, even within the medical community.Inevitably, Lucas will need a Bone Marrow Transplant. The good news is we have already found a perfect match in his sister Dylan (hence the hero title above), but we need to get Lucas into remission first. We must find a treatment plan that targets Lucas’s exact mutation and eradicates the cancer in his bones. To learn more about Lucas’s specific cancer type and share any pertinent information that might help connect them with other families, please visit this page:  https://www.lucasbear.org/beat-aml.The Gourley family decided to relocate to Houston so that Lucas can receive the best care and treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Erin and Brian are solely focused on saving Lucas’s life and being present for Jack and Dylan. They are switching roles every 72 hours at the hospital entrance and only allowed to be with each other for about 15 minutes because Lucas is at constant risk of spiking a fever or other things escalating due to the nature of AML. Their ability to earn income has been severely impacted and the expenses are mounting. Insurance is only covering partial costs of some of Lucas's treatment, as well as the clinical trials and drugs that are in their future. They are doing all of this amidst a pandemic and have limited help due to quarantining restrictions and fear of infection.Lucas is a brave warrior but has a long road ahead of him. This fight will be exhausting on all fronts, but we will do whatever it takes to save Lucas and get him the care he needs. It can take years to recover from the financial devastation that childhood cancer treatment can have on a family. We have started this GoFundMe page as a way to ease some of the financial burden the Gourley family is facing and take a bit of the worry off their plates. We understand that this year has been hard on many people, so if you cannot support financially, please continue to pray for Lucas and his family. Erin and Brian are eternally grateful for all the love and support they have already received, even from people they don’t know. Thank you in advance and please reach out to one of us if you have any questions or other ways to help. With much gratitude and hope, Betsy Flanagan & Kathy Sutherland(friends and prayer warriors)"

He wanted to be a part of every step of the pregnancy; no matter how major or minor; every doctor's appointment, choosing decorations for the nursery, baby movement on the belly, morning sickness- all of it. When he found out he was having a boy, in true Evan fashion, he said that he was just excited to be a dad. But, knowing Ev, having a boy meant the world. He talked about taking him to hockey practice, signing him up for soccer, taking him to day care, even saying if he wanted to be a cheerleader (Anne is a high school cheer coach), that he would be the best and loudest cheer dad there was. This Baxter Scholarship Fund has been set up to make sure no matter what path in life Baby Boy Baxter decides to take, he will be covered no matter what.

She ran for the St. Paul School Board in 2017 to fight for the youth, parents, teachers and community.

She kept her doors open for anyone who needed her support and was passionate about racial justice for refugees, immigrants, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and low income families. She enjoyed spending time with our parents at home, playing board games with our siblings, strategizing about racial justice, and hanging out with close friends. On Sunday, May 3rd, Marny became exhausted, lost her sense of taste, had fevers and chills, and she slept in mostly. She decided to go in for a Covid-19 test on Monday, May 4th. However, on May 6th, she was experiencing shortness of breath. Her face began turning a pale blue and on May 7th at 12:00 AM we decided to call the paramedics for her. We found out that she had very low oxygen and was taken to Regions ICU where she was immediately put on a ventilator. The doctor gave her a COVID-19 test that came back quickly and it was positive. The Regions medical team have tried many options to help her recover. However, her condition became very severe and they had to transport her to the ICU at the University of MN Fairview Hospital for additional oxygen support. She’s recently had two critical, life threatening surgeries. We pray each day that she continues to fight against the virus. We are still waiting for her to improve, make a full recovery and return home. At this time, we anticipate that she will be in the hospital longer because of her critical condition. Thank you to all the family and friends who have reached out to us and continue to pray for her recovery. Lastly, any support is greatly appreciated and will go towards her medical bills. We only wish for our sister, Marny to recover and return home."

Family,Sarah’s Girls,"Vancouver, WA",73814.0,250000.0,75,1.2K,4.5K,"My name is James Jackson III. My sister was Sarah A. Jackson. Sarah died on September 7th Labor Day in Lawrenceville, GA. Sarah’s youngest daughter (9 years old) was wading in the lake with others, unfortunately there was a drop off point nearby. She went underwater and Sarah attempted to reach her. Sarah ingested too much water and went under herself. Others who were nearby were able to pull Sarah’s 9 year old to safety and were able to successfully perform CPR on her. During this life saving effort, Sarah was still underwater for about 5 minutes. Good Samaritans were able to pull Sarah from the water and preform CPR on her for 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived. Sarah was not responsive to the life saving efforts from the Good Samaritans. Sarah was transported to the hospital and her four daughters followed in Sarah’s vehicle. Sarah’s oldest daughter is not an experienced driver and was very brave to drive her sisters under such stressful conditions. Upon arrival to the hospital, the doctors worked on Sarah vigorously as she “code blued” several times. Sarah’s girls arrived shortly thereafter and were able to enter the room to witness their mother being worked on by the doctors. A close friend of Sarah’s arrived and was able to provide comfort to the girls. After seeing too much to ever forget, the younger children were sent into the hallway. Sarah’s oldest child remained in the room sobbing as she gave me a description of the events that were unfolding before her eyes. The doctors told her that there was nothing more they could do. The oldest child did not want to give up on her mother, because her mother never gave up on her when she was a premature baby fighting for her life and needing multiple surgeries thereafter, along with needing a breathing tube for many years. She didn’t want to give up on her mother, despite the doctors telling her that Sarah was gone. The younger girls in the hallway were informed of their mother’s death and drove home alone with Sarah’s friend following behind. Sarah’s friend could not stay with the girls overnight, due to having her own family to get back to. Why wasn’t anyone else called? The girls were in shock, so thinking clearly was not possible. I was in the process of preparing to depart Washington State for Atlanta. I arrived Tuesday afternoon. The back story on why this tragedy occurred must be told. On Sunday morning September 6th, Sarah took her oldest daughter to work. Sarah’s 11 year old wanted to tag along and fell asleep in the back seat.  After Sarah dropped off the oldest child, Sarah was robbed by three masked gunman in Atlanta. They took her purse, all of the purse’s contents and her cell phone. The robbers never noticed the sleeping child in the back seat. Sarah was unharmed and unnerved (she was a tough woman). Sarah had planned to go to Savannah, Georgia  for Labor Day. Due to the theft, Sarah had no identification, cash or credit cards to travel with, so the trip was canceled. In an attempt to cheer up her girls and get out of the house, she elected to go to the lake. Going to the Lake was not out of the ordinary for Sarah and the girls, however, it was a last minute idea to liven the girl’s spirits. Unfortunately for Sarah, she lost her life being exactly what she was  (and always had been), a good mother! Sarah is a hero on so many levels.  Sarah lost her mother at the age of 2, as a result of suicide and never had a loving non abusive gaurdian thereafter. Sarah would  suffer another tragedy in 2006 when our oldest brother committed suicide (Yes, this is all true!). Sarah suffered many injustices as a child. Sarah tried in vain to show her children a better life. Sarah was a single parent living under the poverty line for many years. Sarah was very independent and did not like to ask for assistance. Sarah’s youngest girls have minor health problems related to the respiratory system. Sarah’s oldest daughter will always need to be monitored closey concerning her narrow airways that can become restricted for a multitude of reasons at anytime.  Sarah’s girls are ages  9, 11, 13 and 20. Please help me to provide a fresh start for my nieces, who will be forever scarred by the tragic events that occurred on Labor Day September 7th, 2020. Sincerely, James Jackson III"

Family,Fund for Nurse Ana Kincart's Children,"Cincinnati, OH",71038.0,250000.0,140,1K,7.5K,"Ana Marie Kincart, of Petersburg, Kentucky, died during an act of compassion and duty for a stranger on Monday, July 6, 2020, leaving behind her husband and their four children. She was 36. No one who knew Ana would be surprised to hear that the loving, selfless nurse spent her final moments trying to help someone — and now her heartbroken family is asking for help and prayers as they cope with this unbearable loss. Driving along I-275 on that rainy Monday morning, Ana witnessed a car crash on the Carroll Cropper Bridge in Boone County, Kentucky. Though she was on her way to work at the Lawrenceburg, Indiana VA clinic, Ana immediately stopped to help. ""Being a nurse, she exited her car to check on the young man in the accident,"" said her step-father Andy in a Facebook post. The man she stopped to help was Brandon L. Hicks, 24, of Norwood, Ohio, who was also named in news reports about the accident. ""He was okay, but she stayed to give a statement to the police,"" Andy added.In her last text messages to friends and colleagues, Ana sent a photo of the crash scene and explained why she'd be late for work. But while she and Brandon waited for the authorities to arrive, Ana's SUV was rear-ended by two different vehicles, killing both her and Brandon. A loving wife and mother, Ana is survived by husband Donnie Kincart and their four children, Layla, 9, Tristan, 12, Abby, 18, and Clhoe, 20. In the days since, the family has heard from countless people who knew of the love Ana showed everyone, including a patient's son, who recalled in a letter to the family how often his father praised Ana. ""He has ALWAYS talked about how Ana at his doctor's office was THE BEST!"" wrote the patient's son, whose father suffered a stroke in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. After his father was moved to a different hospital, Ana made a phone call to check on her former patient. ""When I told her what happened to my dad, you could hear the heartfelt amount of concern she had for him,"" the patient's son added. ""Right then and there I knew what my dad had meant when he spoke of her... Not only is she an angel in heaven now, she was also one here on earth."" This GoFundMe is being set up by Ana's relatives and friends as Donnie mourns the death of his wife alongside their children. Prior to Ana's death, Donnie was already facing the stress of chronic health problems that have prevented him from maintaining a reliable work schedule to support the family. All proceeds will be used to directly provide necessities for the children. In the spirit of Ana, please consider making a donation to help the Kincarts, and share this on social media to spread word of this devastated family in need."

Affected individuals develop the characteristic skin symptoms of cutis laxa along with growth deficiencies, moderate to severe intellectual disability, loose joints, cataracts and corneal abnormalities. Additional symptoms may eventually develop including dystonia, a group of movement disorders that vary in their symptoms, causes, progression, and treatments. This group of neurological conditions is generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body in abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). Individuals with this form of cutis laxa usually do not have cardiovascular or pulmonary complications. Many individuals with de Barsy syndrome were found to have a mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene.OUR STORY FROM THE BEGINNING: Baby Nathan was born full term October 2018, weighing just two pounds, but before he was born, doctors had already began to notice he was small. They had my wife Pamela visit a specialist during the end of her second trimester. That’s when it was confirmed, Nathan was not growing normally. “I prepared myself for him being small, I prepared myself for the dwarfism, for whatever came my way,” said Pamela. He wasn’t premature, so Nathan’s size confused physicians. He was in the NICU for observation for 2 months, during this time genetic testing and every test failed to offer answers. Nathan needed to gain weight in order to be discharged. In the following weeks he gained three pounds, then topping five pounds, Nathan was finally ready to be discharged, until the seizures started. Nathan had to be rushed to Valley children’s Hospital In Madera, all test failed there as well. At this time my wife and I were really starting to lose hope, we weren’t getting any answers as to what was going on with our baby. All we saw were tubes, PICC lines and NG tubes. The best word to describe of all of this was a nightmare. As parents we began to question ourselves, we gave into fear and anxiety, did we do something wrong? Was this all our fault? Will our baby survive? So many questions.. The chief geneticist came to us with sad news, In her long time in genetics this was the first time she had seen something like this, so she told us about a state funded program called Project Baby Bear, they conducted a new form of testing called Whole Genome Sequencing. Thanks to that test we received a diagnosis called Cutis Laxa Type 3 from a denovo mutation called ALDH18A1, Non inherited. The symptoms are growth deficiencies, moderate to severe intellectual disability, loose joints and skin, cataracts, corneal abnormalities, mal rotation, seizures, involuntary muscle contractions that force the body in abnormal, sometimes painful movements and positions, trouble eating, hernias, cyclic vomiting and severe acid reflux.  We are extremely grateful to have a diagnosis but we are now facing a disease that has no cure, or treatments. We were discharged from the hospital March 2019. Since then we have focused on raising awareness, reaching out to as many people as we can, not only raise awareness but to find other people with this disease. So far there are only 3 other people in the world with this diagnosis. Here we are close to his second birthday and have learned so much about acceptance and perseverance, Regardless of this situation, we remain positive. We believe that everything happens for a reason. Nathan has inspired thousands of people so far, although it might be a difficult situation we have to follow baby Nathan’s example of never giving up, He’s a warrior, destined for greatness. How you define greatness is completely up to you. There’s a word in our family that we always use called Auspicious, it means conducive to success, favorable. We like to remind everyone that we are all auspicious. We like to focus on the journey not the destination, worrying about the future only bring anxiety so we will continue this path together, as long as Nathan doesn’t give up, neither will we. Stray strong, we hope that our story can inspire you, you’re not alone. We’re in this together, remember you ARE Auspicious!!THANK YOU TO THE LABRANT FAMILY FOR ALL OF THEIR LOVE. YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC8gYfDyYTI&feature=youtu.be INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/auspiciousmando/"

Family,Krist Angielen Castro Guzman Family Fund,"Chicago, IL",59622.0,50000.0,206,975,12.8K,"On May 2, 2020, Krist Angielen Castro Guzman lost her battle against COVID. She will be dearly missed by all who were blessed to have known and loved her. During her 35 precious years with us, Krist bravely faced change and adversity with steadfast poise and resolution. In this fashion, she learned to love adventure as she traveled the world with her family as my Uncle Angel, a now retired Navy Senior Chief, and Auntie Lillie worked to serve and protect our country. Being the eldest sibling to my cousins Anjo and Kayla, Krist set the bar for exceeding expectations as a life-long learner, a loyal and honest friend, and a strong and fierce nurturer. She made her parents proud when she made the decision to settle in Chicago as she pursued her dreams of becoming a nurse. She was a frontliner who treated all her patients and colleagues with respect and dignity. It was while working as a nurse that she met her beloved husband Omar and through their love, created more love through their 3 darling children Livvy Rogue- 6, Xavi Lionel- 5, and Leandro Christiano- 4 months. Family was always her first priority. Near or far, she cherished her God children, nieces, nephews, cousins, extended family across the globe, and she strongly built bonds with everyone she welcomed into her circle. She was a source of light and love to everyone she encountered with her adventurous spirit, lion heart, and unquenchable thirst for life. 

In the wake of her passing, she leaves behind broken hearts all over the world, especially her young children and grieving husband. In her loving memory, please consider contributing to this fund towards medical and funeral expenses, and her family's future."
Family,Kris MacLeod's Enduring Wish,"Lombard, IL",59910.0,100000.0,76,426,2.4K,"Just over a year ago , Kris MacLeod learned the devastating news that she had gastric cancer. None of her family or friends could imagine that Kris would do anything but obliterate this horrible illness. In her daughters words, “If cancer was simply a battle of the mind, my mom would have banished cancer all over the world by now!”... Kris was a warrior. Many people saw her strength but few knew what she was battling until the end. Kris’s story is a hard one to tell for that reason, up until the day she passed we all believed she would beat this.

The cancer was caught early and Kris was optimistic about her prognosis. Like said above, Kris and family could not imagine this would end up taking her life. Kris had recently left her job of 20+ years earlier that summer and was excited to begin work at a newer company that was closer to her home. She was especially excited about the increased salary and better health benefits she would receive, but a few days before starting her new job Kris began having complications after a routine laparoscopy performed to determine whether the cancer had spread. Kris delayed the start of her new job several times but, in the end, was too sick to ever begin. Kris was hospitalized for several weeks to deal with the laparoscopy issues and endured two surgeries, infected stitches, and many more unimaginable setbacks and complications. Kris’s husband, Ian, was by Kris’s side the entire time. Ian continued on at his job- the only income for their household at that point- while being by Kris’s side, taking care of their two young boys, Alec and Connor, in addition to all of the other demands of their increasingly complicated life. Ian was laid off in December, choosing the only option for him which was to fight by his wife’s side.As if things weren’t difficult enough, life decided to throw a curveball at us all. The COVID pandemic hit hard, making Kris’s many hospital stays all the more lonely and stressful on the MacLeod family. It is impossible to relate how many surgeries, setbacks, infections, and hospital stays Kris endured these past 13 months. Through it all, with Ian at her side, she remained optimistic that better days were ahead. Kris fought with every ounce of energy she had, everyday the cancer got stronger so did she... But, we can’t always choose how our body fights and Kris ultimately passed in September, 2020.Kris had very few “good days” during the past 13 months, but when she was having one, her bright smile was not changed by cancer. There was no income, health care was running out due to the national health pandemic, time with family and friends as severely limited ... but Kris fought for over a year for her family, friends and love of life.

Nobody deserves this. Especially not Kris who gave so much to so many; Kris with her bright shining smile and caring heart; Kris who volunteered and donated and cared deeply about her community; Kris who did everything possible to have more time with Ian and her children; Kris who was taken far too soon. Kris left behind her loving husband, beautiful children, Jane (19), Alec (12), and Connor (7) and countless heartbroken friends and family. We now have the opportunity to help Kris’s family out of the financial ruin caused by job loss, cancer, and a pandemic. Let’s come together to help Kris’s family during a time of insurmountable pain and loss.EDIT: Gofundme needs me to provide the following so we can withdraw the money for Kris's family when we need to.

- This gofundme was organized by Kris's brother, Jerry Nash with help from multiple friends and family.  I am Ian's brother-in-law and Jane, Alec, and Connor's uncle. EDIT 2:Who you are and where you’re from: I am Jerry Nash and I'm from Decatur ILYour relationship or contact to the parties you're raising funds for: I am brother in law to Ian and uncle to his childrenHow the funds will be spent (be as specific as possible): The funds will be spent towards day to day expenses and maybe even mortgage payments. Your withdrawal plan to get the funds from the fundraiser to the person that they're intended for: I plan to withdraw the funds straight to Ian's, (Kris's husband) bank account. If a beneficiary has been added, make sure your story includes the beneficiary’s name and relation to your cause: The whole story above explains everything. - I am Jerry Nash, Kris's brother, from Decatur Illinois-I am Kris's brother- On October 11th we will be depositing all raised funds straight into Ian's bank account. I tried to withdraw funds before October 11 and gofundme raised a red flag. I have been trying to battle them to get the money to a bank account since then."

Family,Brother Thinh's Boys,"Tampa, FL",53058.0,1000000.0,140,393,2.4K,"Dear Friends,Many of you have been with me at the start of my mission to raise funds to help my brother and his family and know the story of the stroke that put Thinh in the hospital for 92 days, 78 of them completely alone without the comfort of family or friends due to Covid-19, and much of those days in a coma. Thank heavens for the loving care of the amazing medical staff at Tampa General Hospital who went to great lengths to help our family and Thinh's friends keep in touch with him through daily phone calls and twice-weekly video visits. Profound thanks also to all our musical friends who shared their talents on our video visits with Thinh to lift all our spirits and permeate Thinh's inner world with beauty.I petitioned for and (with the help of fierce allies among the medical staff of Tampa General Hospital who tenaciously advocated for me with the administrators) was granted special permission to enter TGH to live with Thinh 24/7 in his room and help work toward Thinh's discharge. When I entered TGH, Thinh was barely responsive and receiving all his nutrition through a feeding tube. 14 days later, he had demonstrated that he could still read, was responding to questions on a tablet, eating and drinking by mouth using a fork and cup in his own good hand, smiling for the first time since his stroke, and even high-fiving the nurses.Thinh and I left the hospital together on August 19th. Afterwards, I had the privilege of caring for Thinh with help from his wife, my various siblings, my brother-in-law, dear friends, and his nurse and aid. Everyday, Thinh did everything that was asked of him for his healing, and more. Always more. And always with a love, gentle grace, and valiant humility.Very soon, his feeding tube came out. He had stopped coughing up sputum and was on his way toward getting his tracheostomy out. He exercised himself at physical therapy no matter how severe the pain. He bore the diminishments of his body with peaceful rectitude. He sat through hours of speech therapy, willing himself to remain awake, pushing his vocal chord and muscles to do his will despite the apraxia and obvious exhaustion until the scheduled end. He smiled for family and friends. He gave hugs and kisses. When he was sad, and finally able to do so, he cried. But he never stopped trying. Never stopped doing. Everyday, Thinh woke and forged on, until a sudden and catastrophic event took his life early in the morning of October 10, 2020.On his final night, Thinh enjoyed a music lesson on the recorder and a fine dinner surrounded by dear friends and (via video) his sons, wife, some siblings, spouses, and various nephews and nieces. I talked with Thinh as usual after cleaning his tracheostomy, brushing his teeth, etc. to prepare him for bed. My final words to him before kissing him toward dreams that night, as on every night prior, were essentially: You are beautiful. Your spirit is beautiful  and strong. Your mind is brilliant. You may not yet be wholly healed out in this world, but in your mind you can be however you want to be, and do whatever you want to do. So  be completely well, and do something wonderful for yourself. Go somewhere beautiful. Take whomever you want with you. Enjoy your journey, and if you feel like it, tuck away some memories to share when you are able to voice more freely again. Then I told Thinh that I love him and would see him in the morning.I shared much the same sentiments with Thinh the night before. And too, a promise that I would care for him and his family, particularly his boys Michael Thien, Ryan Tai, Jason Thuan (Boo-Boo) and Jaxson Toan (Du-Du) as long as needed. And so I do.And I ask for your help in keeping my promise to my brother.Please reach out to me with any question or concerns at either of the following:Phone: (925) 222-1582. Please leave a message, and I will return your call.Email: please use the CONTACT button on this page or boys.of.thinh with the @gmail.com suffix.Cash donations can be made here or by contacting me directly.In-kind donations can be sent to 5719 N Artesian Ave, Apt 1, Chicago, IL 60659Please share this page with others who might be in a position to help.Gratefully,Phoenix Thuy-Phuong NguyenP.S.

This sudden, terrible loss has left a hole in all our lives and we are scrambling to surround Valerie's husband, Michael, and their two young children, Emerson and Whitman, with the support they need to get through a difficult year dealing with residual medical bills, child care, transitional insurance, and expenses for a memorial Michael never expected to plan.Since being diagnosed with Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma in 2016, Valerie endured multiple surgeries and debilitating treatments while continuing to teach and be the amazing wife and mother she has always been. Both teachers of writing, Michael and Valerie had schedules that minimized the need for childcare and they relied on insurance from Valerie's tenured position at Wilbur Wright College. Valerie was so young and so brave that even when the cancer metastasized to her brain, we thought we would have more time: time enough for her to survive this recurrence, find effective treatment, and raise her children, who are 8 and 5. Now it's left to us to buy time for Michael so he can focus on caring for the kids, grieving Valerie, and adapting to everything they now must face without the partner and mother they love so much.We are beyond grateful for any and all assistance you are able to provide. Thank you."

Family,RavenLilly,"New Britain, CT",48721.0,100000.0,115,688,2.7K,"Maria, my younger sister just lost her fiance at the age of 29. Tyler left behind a beautiful little girl who is only 4.5 months old.  As a small business owner in these times he unfortunately did not have life insurance or anything to leave behind to help support his family and his little girl. 
I'm setting up this fund in the hopes of providing a safety net for the two of them and contribute towards Ravens education & maybe on a downpayment on a house. Currently they live in an 800sq/f rental and their dream was always to have a home for Raven that had a yard. As her big brother I feel it is my responsibility to help alleviate any financial uncertainty or struggle. I understand that times are tough for all of us, but if you are able to help in any way it would mean the world to my sister and to Raven. To be able to know that Raven's future has some sense of security. Thank you all, please stay safe, hug and kiss your loved ones often fore we don't know what obstacles or life altering hurdles life may throw our way."

Family,Declan’s Treasure Chest,"East Hartford, CT",51486.0,100000.0,44,556,3.8K,"Declan’s Treasure ChestTreasure. There is no other word that aptly describes the beautiful soul that was Alita Rumph. She was selfless, loving, kind, and bountifully generous. A loving and devoted wife, she fervently dreamed to give her husband a child. Finally, after over twelve years, this dream became a reality. Chris and Alita would have their child! It was an answer to prayer, and a dream fulfilled. The sweet nature of their story took a bitter turn, however, when at the beginning of the pregnancy Alita was also diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. In what was nothing less than an act of epic heroism, Alita refused any treatments for this deadly disease. Knowing full well that this diagnosis might result in her own death, Alita, modeling the life of the Savior she unwaveringly served, chose to lay down her life for the life of her son. Just as heroically, she unequivocally rejected any thoughts of aborting their long-awaited gift in order to preserve her own life.This heroic saga took more tragic turns, as Alita’s body, desperately trying to keep both itself and the baby alive, battled more than the cancer. Diagnosed with both gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, Alita’s body battled with every reserve of strength and fortitude available. Together, Chris and his treasure, Alita, stood strongly and fought valiantly for the life of their miracle child. On April 24th, at 6:05 p.m., Declan Christopher Asher Rumph was born. What joy this brought to these amazing folks! Yet the heroic nature of this saga was still being written. Declan was born 31 days before his due date. This miracle boy immediately took on the very nature of the mother who birthed him. For the next 26 days, Declan Christopher Asher, whose name means “man of prayer, Christ-anointed, happy and blessed,” fought as valiantly for his own life as his mother had fought for him. For the first 25 days of his life, Declan lived in the NICU, each day winning a new battle that would bring him closer to survival. Alita and Chris continued their battle as well, as they devoted every minute of their lives to giving their dream and miracle every chance to live.Joyously, Declan survived, and was able to come home on May 19th, one week before his original due date. He came home fully developed, and with no further health concerns. Meanwhile, the tragic nature of the story was not yet fully written. Alita’s body remained under brutal attack by the cancer that now literally racked her body with pain. Further testing revealed that the cancer had spread throughout her body, and there was little to nothing the doctors could do to save her. Desperately, Chris and Alita prayed and believed for another miracle. However, for reasons no one fully understands, God chose to bring His treasure home to be with him. Forever thankful for the five and a half months God granted them together, Alita passed over to the arms of her Savior on Friday, October 9, 2020 at 7:30 p.m., with her loving husband at her side. We grieve for our loss, and rejoice with her as she experiences her eternal reward. Yet in all of this, we realize that the story is not over. Chris and baby Declan still remain with us. They will have many struggles to face together. While their story is full of tragedy, we would like to help be a part of the story turning from tragedy to triumph. Chris, in caring and battling for his treasure Alita and their joint treasure, Declan, has put on hold his business, and therefore all sources of income. Alita’s job as a teacher provided the only benefits their family had. Now Chris faces the uphill climb to determine how these things will now be provided. Chris and Declan do not need the stress of carrying such heavy load alone at this time. There is a great future ahead for them, and in order to secure this future, we would love to raise enough financial resources to help sustain them and provide something to get them started. Alita was treasured by all who knew her. Let’s give from the treasure of our hearts to the legacy of treasure she leaves behind, by donating what we can to “Declan’s Treasure Chest.” “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” 2 Corinthians 4:7"

She had been hospitalized since March 27th. My Mother's death has rattled our lives forever. Additionally, her husband, our step father,  was met with the same fate and lost his life on April 11th.She was a wife, sister, daughter, friend, colleague and a giver. But her most important role was being our mother. Mom leaves behind her children; myself (Katherine), Jennifer, Andy and 2 adopted children Zavion (4) and Jazzmyn (2). We have never been more devastated. Mom was our EVERYTHING. There is so much we can say but in short, she was the undisputed best cook ever, she had a contagious laugh and the most giving heart.  She was loved by everyone who knew her and was at her happiest when hosting family gatherings. There are voids that my siblings and I will never be able to fill.Saying these circumstances are challenging is an understatement. Our family could use all the support. My siblings and I became parents over night, we have funeral expenses and legal fees, amongst other things. Thank you in advance for all of your generosity. We truly appreciate it and will never forget to pay it forward.  Please continue to keep our family in your prayers."
Newlywed,Ada and Kylie's Wedding Fund,"Chicago, IL",13990.0,15000.0,58,106,310,"I'm Kylie (on the right), and this is Ada (left). And we're getting married.A few years ago, neither of us dreamed we'd be here, as a queer/trans transnational couple. And now that we are, it's wonderful! It's also complicated.

I live in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. Ada lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Our wedding is in November. Because of COVID, it's going to be smaller than we'd like, with fewer of our loved ones there than we would like. But we're both absolutely thrilled to enter this part of our lives!

That's where the challenges start, though. We have to re-separate almost immediately after the marriage. We have to go through the immigration process, with its fees and document requirements and waiting periods. I need to get a visa approved, to be reunited, and I have a waiting time before I'd be able to legally work in Canada. I have to be approved to practice law in Ontario, since my bar license doesn't work there. We have to find a place to live together. And of course there are the practical costs of moving across a closed border.

These challenges are really, really exciting! And we look forward to facing them together. But every step will be easier, and safer, with your help. This is our reunification fund. While we can't invite everyone - or really, anyone - to be a part of the ceremony, we would be deeply honored if you would be a part of our journey in building our new life together.

This is, for better or worse, still a GoFundMe, and it's our responsibility to provide our goals and needs. The concrete goals we've set post-ceremony are:Immigration/Visa Proceedings (administrative and legal costs);Relocation (on-ground moving and subsistence costs);Licensure (application fees, testing fees, and bar exam fees); andCohabitation (deposit on an apartment or a house, and furnishing).

Each of these bears costs, and they aren't trivial. Filing for sponsorship and permanent residency alone begins at $1050.00 USD. In lieu of gifts or travel, we ask for your assistance in meeting those practical costs. This is also our promise that funds received will go towards these goals. We have no intention of taking the money and going on a vacation - let's face it, there really isn't anywhere to go.

This is also why we haven't provided specific fundraising targets. Your participation in this new stage of our lives is a kindness on your part. We don't want to set an obligation to donate or incentivize it. We sure don't want anyone to decide whether or not this endeavor was a success based upon fundraising. It's already a success to have gotten this far. What it isn't is a way to bully friends into buying us registry paraphernalia (Solid Brass Duck Press, $2999, Williams Sonoma). Our initial goal is set at $15,000, a number that we believe should be sufficient to cover foreseeable immigration fees, visa fees, the costs of moving, the cost of downtime prior to work permission, and, with luck, the cost of any unforeseen eventualities.

We'll progressively update with more concrete goals as we develop them. That may be ""put a deposit on an apartment and buy a sofa."" With luck, it may be ""put a down payment on a home."" It may just be ""reunite,"" which would itself be amazing. Whatever it is, we'll update to let you know exactly what your kindness helped us achieve. If anyone would like more specific fund-management details, I am happy to provide those as well.

We're both fortunate to have met one another, and we're fortunate to be supported by absolutely exceptional folks. We draw friendship and companionship from a broad spectrum of many different communities. We owe our health and lives to you, and we'd be very, very grateful if you'd all walk with us on these next steps of our journey."
Newlywed,Austin & Katey's Dream Wedding and Adventures,"Pflugerville, TX",13574.0,10000.0,184,114,911,"At just 21 years old, Katey Malin has been bravely fighting ependymoma brain cancer since 2015. She has spent time at St.Judes Children's Hospital and here in Austin at Dell Children's Hospital undergoing extensive surgeries and treatments. Katey is a graduate of Leander High School where she was a proud Blue Belle and even through all of her hospital stays has still kept up and succeeded with her classes at Texas State University. Everyone who knows Katey, knows what a special young lady she is.  Katey met Austin in middle school and after her first surgery, they reconnected on Facebook. They went on their first date the following January on Katey's birthday and they they have been together ever since. He has been right be her side through all of this and they are truly a picture of what unconditional love is. On April 23, 2020, Katey went in for a routine scan and port surgery, and the doctors found 3 new spots on her brain. The doctors told Katey's family, her precious parents Ken and Belinda Malin, that  it won't be years but months that sweet Katey has left.  Austin, Katey's boyfriend made the decision to propose and Katey SAID YES! We are all so happy for Austin and Katey, that even in the midst of all of this, LOVE WINS. Austin and Katey will be married in Burnet, TX on July 18, 2020. As you can imagine, with medical bills, planning a wedding could be stressful and we want to not only take that stress away, but we want to make it THE DREAM WEDDING for Katey and Austin. We also want this money to be used for Austin and Katey to experience as much as they can and make as many memories together as possible. Let's join together, family and friends of the Malin's and Austin and help make this dream come true for a very special young lady and a beautiful couple that deserves the world."
Newlywed,Brenner Eubank Wedding Fundraiser for Belwop,"Mountain View, CA",12058.0,25000.0,65,62,26,"Dear Friends and FamilyWe have been blessed in so many amazing ways, and we're forever grateful to our family and friends who have been a part of our lives and whose generosity we do not take for granted. As a new family, we feel strongly called to be good stewards of our resources. For this reason, rather than a traditional registry, we have set up a fundraiser for the Belwop Rescue Center and Children’s Home. Belwop gives hope and a home to the abused, neglected, and orphaned children of Nyeri county, Kenya. Started in 2005 by Veronica Mumbi, Belwop began and continues as an orphanage that creates an environment to foster learning, personal growth and equal rights. Belwop has grown over the years, helping countless children and developing many projects to meet the needs of children and young people throughout the local community. The Belwop name comes from the idea that even without formal identification, such as a birth certificate or even a recorded name, a child can still have an identity, a home and a future. Central to Belwop’s work is its Rescue Centre. The Belwop Rescue Centre gives orphaned, neglected and abused children a home where they are able to grow up with a loving mom, a great education and a stable home life.Paige visited Belwop in 2018 and absolutely fell in love with these amazing kids and the mission of Belwop, and we’ve done our best to stay involved and support the mission ever since. Chris and Paige have frequent calls with Veronica to check in, and before the “great replanning” we were excited to have Veronica join us on 10-10 in Santa Barbara. After COVID, we hope to visit Belwop again. We hope that we can redirect the generosity of our friends and family to this amazing cause, so that our wedding can be not only a celebration of our new marriage, but can be of an incredible impact to these children.We know that this is a challenging time for many, and we do not want anyone to feel obligated to give. But if you do feel inclined to help us start our marriage off on a strong foundation, there is nothing that would make the two of us happier than getting to support this amazing organization.Some logistics:Belwop is a partner of Extreme Response International, which handles the fundraising in the US for Belwop. We’ve been in touch with the CFO of Extreme Response to arrange that the donations from our wedding fundraiser will be destined for Belwop. To make giving as easy as possible, we’ve set up a GoFundMe connected directly to Extreme Response. Extreme Response is a registered not-for-profit organization in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, the Philippines and South Africa, so it may be that your donations are tax deductible (check with your favorite tax professional!). If you work for a company that does donation matching, you can amplify your impact by using your company's matching donation portal, just be sure to add in the comments of your donation to Extreme Response that it is a part of the Brenner Eubank wedding fundraiser and that the funds should be destined for Belwop.Thanks again for all the love and support during these tough times. We hope that together we can plant a seed for Belwop that will benefit for years to come. We love you all!Chris and Paige"

Newlywed,Paint the Wedding! And the Void!,"San Francisco, CA",6375.0,1.0,129,49,0,"Dear Friends, we are postponing the Power Clash Ball.  But do not fear! We have reorganized and embraced a new version of our Covid-Era Nuptials. Many of you have asked about gifts or if we have a registry. We appreciate your generosity and we have thought of something that will commemorate the nuptials, our community and this crazy time:We are commissioning a wedding mural via Paint the Void! The mural will commemorate our ceremony and will be painted on boards and displayed at a local business that has been shut down d/t COVID19. Once that business reopens, the mural will be touched up and moved to its forever-home in our living room!We have chosen local artist Jordan Herren  to do the piece.  Jordan is an Asian-American Bay Area native and a fantastic street artist. He has agreed to come to our ceremony to get a first-hand view of the scene, and then use his artistic talents to make a colorful and memorable mural so we can remember it forever. Paint the Void  (news ) has been our partner in facilitating this art.  It's a COVID-era non-profit, started in March of 2020, that has the mission of beautifying San Francisco in this dark time by commissioning local artists to paint murals on boarded-up businesses all across the Bay Area. It adds beauty while giving talented artists real work. We are huge fans.  Special thanks to our dear friend Inga Bard for putting in extra work to make this happen. All proceeds will go to Paint the Void and Jordan. We feel that this is a win-win-win for us, our community, and the Bay Area in general. We get to support a local non-profit, a local artist, and beautify a local business that has been impacted by COVID19. And PLUS we get a cherished memento of our special day. We love you all, and we appreciate your support and generosity!!   Firen & Brady PS - Jordan's Paint the Void Mural. The main photo is from our rehearsal and then stylized to look like a painting. :-)"

Newlywed,Support the newlyweds to stay together,"Grand Rapids, MI",6025.0,6000.0,165,66,977,"Hello everyone, my name is Kongcheng Kimyang. This past May 31st, I got marry to the most beautiful and loving woman I know, Haju Kimyang, the love of my life who came from across the ocean literally. She is intelligent, independent, strong, joyful, diligent, faithful, hardworking, and always humble before God. Haju is a woman who knows how to love others around her and knows how to be there for them. She always helps me to be a better man before God and before others. 

Haju and I met in 2016 our freshman year of college. She always tried her best to do the work God gave her. No matter if that’s working, studying, or loving others, she always have done her best. We have gone through some hardships after I proposed to Haju in 2019. Our engagement season was filled with unmeasurable amount of tears and desperate prayers. We prayed God to give us wisdom and peace to go through that season. There were so much unbearable difficulties in our lives especially for Haju. The pain was killing her from the inside. I had to watch her almost losing the light and joys which always sparkled in her eyes. It was one of the most painful times of my life watching the love of my life losing her passion for the Church, smiles, and hating herself and others from the deep end. She was not the bright and joyful person I knew. Depression and anxiety took her over. By the grace of God, so many people around us helped Haju to fight that pain back. I witnessed how God heals our pain and redeems our darkness with my bear eyes through Haju’s recovery. She bravely fought that suffocating depression and anxiety that were taking her breath away. She and I finished our undergrad this April and she finished it off the program with summa cum laude. Sadly, COVID took our precious graduation ceremony away and also messed up our wedding plan that was supposed to be on the 1st of May. Her biggest disappointment was her family had to cancel their flight due to COVID. She was sad on the rehearsal day not having her mom right next to her. But through all these chaotic moments, God taught us how we are to trust God and depend on Him in every situation. Now, we are married and we are still going strong before God, now as a married couple. This month, we are facing a big step as a newlywed. Haju’s student visa allows 60 days of grace period upon graduation which will end this month. Our original plan got messed up completely because of COVID-19, and now we are in a lot of needs. Originally, we were thinking of applying for Haju’s green card towards at the end of this year (2020) as we will work and have to save application fee and extra charges which is close to $5000. So, Haju applied for a work visa and still waiting for the approval. However, due to the pandemic, now the government is considering closing off the OPT program (US college graduates work permit upon graduation) and we are not sure if the application will go through or not. Because of this, we now have to apply for her green card as soon as we can before this month ends to make sure that she can stay in the US with me. If her visa just expires without any other visa, she will have to leave to Korea which will cost more money and time, and especially a long, unpredictable time away from each other right after we got married. Your donation will go to pay the application fee and attorney fee, to help us paying other bills, and also to help our new start as a married couple because we are in a very tight financial situation. Any amount of help will make a big difference in our lives."
Newlywed,A Stolen Wedding- help Erick & Corwina,"Portland, OR",5830.0,5000.0,66,52,94,"This weekend (Sept. 18) my brother Erick (aka Bro) and his Fiancé Corwina had their house broken into, ransacked and robbed.  In addition to their passports, personal belongings and other items, they had all the money they had been saving up for their 2021 wedding and honeymoon stolen from them.  They have insurance that covers damages and some of the items that were taken, after deductible, but insurance does not cover any stolen cash.

During these hard times they have been working extra and long hours to scrape and save money for their wedding and their FUTURE.   They wanted a good safety net  to protect them. They both work so very hard and I’m heartbroken and want to do something to help my wonderful brother. As a lot of you know, my brother and Corwina are very giving individuals who are constantly helping others and never asking for anything in return.   During the wild fires they let several families who had to be evacuated stay with them.  This is one of many examples.  

They would never do a Go Fund Me on their own because that is just not who they are.   I’ve not told my brother I’m doing this.  I know there are many of you out there that they have helped and touched your lives..... and perhaps some of you would like to pay it forward and lend them a helping hand  

I am grateful for anything you can share with my brother and Corwina...  prayers, kindness, a small donation.    Thank you so very much, Jen"

Newlywed,Help Joce & Andrew After Wedding Venue files BK,"Irvine, CA",4513.0,25000.0,143,45,125,"This is the story of Andrew An and Joceyln Shimizu. On July 1st, 2020 Joceyln and Andrew got an email from New York Food Company (NYFC) letting them know that  NYFC was going into bankruptcy and that Joce & Andrew were out their deposit of over $26,000!  The news was stunning and a shock!  Joce & Andrew had been so careful to select a venue with a successful track record and years in business.   It seemed, that while NYFC had been in business for 41 successful years they had not saved any money, did not have a good business plan, had apparently been left out of any aid (they would have qualified for PPP so it is unclear if they got aid or applied for it) and would no longer exist moving forward.  They asked that  no one blame them and yet they made no offer to refund the money paid for an event not even on the books til September 2020 (the original date) and then August 2021 (the rescheduled date). NYFC made no ""we are sorry, no phone call"" and gave no real explanation as to what had happened.  They only offered excuses, blame (in their letter they talk about how they have lost 2 million in future dollars from lost revenue from their catering business due to COVID and corporation not catering lunches but nothing about what they had used their client's wedding deposits on), an email and a disconnected phone #.   Obviously I could go on and on about what NYFC did wrong.... but the reason for this Go Fund Me page is hearing the heartbreak of my friend when she found out that all the money she and her parents had saved and put up in advance for the wedding was gone.   I could hear the guilt in her voice.  I could hear her berating herself for spending that kind of money on a wedding.... practical, kind, frugal Joceyln.   Never asking anything for herself.  Feeling guilty and bad because she had accepted HELP from her family for a wedding.  She was not crying about not getting her dream wedding, she was crying about the loss and that her parents had sacrificed to give her this wedding that was now lost. Joceyln and Andrew will make the best of this bad situation.  That is who they are.  They will have a simple wedding in the backyard of her parents house.  They will be happy.  They will have children and they will be a blessing to this world because that is who they are.   I am hoping they won't have to skimp and do without the dream wedding they had saved and paid for.  I am hoping that those of you who know Andrew and Jocelyn will want to join me in helping to ease their pain,  their disappointment and the stress of paying for another wedding (it is unlikely that they will get any money back from the bankruptcy court.... and certainly not anytime soon).   I am hoping that we can rally around them and give them the wedding that they saved, planned and paid for.... I have calculated that if 500 of us donate $50 we can get them 25K back.  If 1000 people donate $25 we can get them the 25K back and if 2500 people donate $10 each then we can get the 25k back.   My thought is that thru Keller Williams,  friends, family and strangers who empathize we can try to make them whole again and give them hope that there is some good in this world.  That the Universe is not against them.  That every dark cloud has a silver lining and that people really do care.    I am starting them off with $1000 (I am going to Venmo to save the $29 GoFundMe fee) but will add another $50 here which is what I am asking each of you to consider and to pay GoFundMe for this platform.   I know this is a hard time for everyone and that a wedding may not seem like a big deal... but Jocelyn and Andrew waited, saved, did everything they were supposed to do before you start a life together.   They wanted to do it right and I just don't think they should have to start again by themselves.... not if their friends, family and work family can help out a bit.... Any amount helps.  Anything is appreciated.   Thank you."

Newlywed,We're getting wed & starting a publishing company,"Emeryville, CA",4340.0,1.0,152,48,60,"
We (Chelsea and Nick) are getting married. Due to the pandemic, it will be a quiet ceremony in our backyard with no guests. Since we already have a comfortable home and plenty of appliances, and there is no way we can go on a honeymoon in the near future, we are accepting donations in the spirit of our love to help establish our company Modern Mythology Press.We already have published Nick's novel ""Hitomi"" and will publish Chelsea's upcoming poetry book ""I've Had Lovers"". In the next few years, we'd like to publish anthologies from new writers, and offer advances to some of those writers to develop their own manuscripts. We will focus on writers who advance new thought-forms and push them forward, with particular emphasis on marginalized voices.

The money from this fundraiser will go to stipends to writers, and printing costs for new publications.

And a few years ago, the Lord had us leave our jobs (sources of income) to follow Him! It was an easy ""Yes!"" from us. From volunteering, missionary work, and international missions trips, to operating an Independent Record Label and working towards a bachelor's degree etc. the Lord has used our yes in a way we never could’ve imagined. But it hasn't been a walk in the park. Our faith HAS BEEN tested; along with God showing us tremendous accounts of supernatural provision on our faith walk journey, such as:1) Providing us both with plane tickets to serve Bushveld Mission Children's Home in South Africa ✈️2) Providing food, gas, bills, emergencies in different ways on a monthly basis3)Enabling us to start paying off our debts 4)Engagement ring etc.This marriage is definitely a new chapter of our faith walk. We believe that even in the midst of a pandemic and volunteering/serving with our life rather than working for money, we can reach what God has for us! 2 Corinthians 5:7 ""...for we walk by faith, not by sight [living our lives in a manner consistent with our confident belief in God’s promises]""Mark 11:24""For this reason I am telling you, whatever things you ask for in prayer [in accordance with God’s will], believe [with confident trust] that you have received them, and they will be given to you.""What your blessing will go towards:- Venues (Ceremony + Reception)- Dress + Suit- Cinematographer- Decor- Catering- Travel expenses- Honeymoon- Our first apartment!

Newlywed,Brigid and Jake's Running Water Fund,"Washburn, WI",4205.0,10000.0,87,33,204,"We wish all the wonderful family and friends in our life could have been able to attend in person, but of course had to drastically reduce our guest count in order to stay safe during the pandemic. Hopefully everyone else was able to enjoy the Zoom version of the wedding ceremony. The day was perfect, and although we had a small physical audience we could feel the love of everyone thinking of us on our special day. We absolutely do not expect wedding gifts from anybody but have had many very generous people in our lives wanting to give gifts. Because of that we decided to put together this go fund me page in lieu of a registry. If you can give anything at all towards our running water fund we would greatly appreciate it but of course nothing is expected.We have been living in our northwoods home for 3 years now and have slowly been making additions to our farm. We raise goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and a vegetable garden while also growing microgreens year round. All this time we have been hauling the majority of our water from the artesian well in Washburn and catching rainwater off our roof. This has been a great way to offset the need for a gym membership but isn't the most efficient system.To celebrate this beautiful moment of our lives, we have decided to have a well dug on our property. This will save us from late night trips to well and chipping away at the ice volcano that forms around the well after several straight months of sub-freezing temperatures. Our coworkers, friends, and family will appreciate our increased ability to shower much more frequently! Thank you all so very much!"

Mikell’s initial plan was to invite people over to their building's rooftop after the engagement and order in some pizzas, but we are hoping to surprise them with something way better!As you know, Jen is a master of planning. She is incredible at bringing people together and figuring out the ideal schedule to keep everyone entertained. Unfortunately for Jen, an engagement party is the one thing she can't plan for herself. But that’s where we come in! If we all come together we can surprise them both with a night that is truly one to remember, and hopefully up to Jen's high standards ;)The truth is that Jen and Mikell are both remarkable people who have made every right decision along the way and consistently put others before themselves. Right now they are both the only ones in their families who are currently employed and this has undoubtedly put pressure on them. They have made large financial sacrifices to keep family afloat, and while they are willing to compromise on things like an engagement party, this can be a moment where we show up for them and blow them away with a night that we will all enjoy together.All funds will go towards venue, food+drinks, music, and ambiance for creating a special intimate evening. If there happens to be any leftover funds it will be put onto a gift card that Jen and Mikell can use to finish furnishing their new apartment.Here is a link to the venue we are hoping to book: https://www.peerspace.com/pages/listings/5a723c7c86febbf101ca3a04?sort_order=2We will continue to update this page with progress as plans solidify, and also welcome any ideas and alternative ways of contributing.PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THIS LINK WITH ANYONE AND KEEP CONFIDENTIAL SO THIS CAN REMAIN A SURPRISE!Cheers,Je'kell Engagement Party Planning Committee"
Newlywed,"Robert and Krystal’s wedding, apartment, & life","Tacoma, WA",3855.0,10000.0,146,33,166,"Krystal and Robert are both missionaries in Germany. They are getting married. They literally don’t have any furniture for their apartment.  They have been gifted a place for a honeymoon, but spending money is minimal. She has been skimping in her wedding as well. We want to bless the socks off these amazing people that are so generous with their finances and life to serve the Lord.  Let’s serve them back. 

Here’s a bit of their story:

Robert comes from a complicated past with a lifestory that will need to be made into a book someday. I am constantly impressed by how much he has spent life discovering truth and solutions and then turning to face even the difficult things head-on. God has been with him and walked every step of the way even before he was fully conscious of this role God was having in his life. Krytal comes from a deeply-rooted Christian (Nazarene) family. She says ""I have never questioned the truth of God and only had the task of making Him my own God, not just my family’s... which is also a bit of an adventure, because life with Jesus always is!""Robert had lived in various countries on four continents, taken on various jobs, and mostly meeting lots of interesting people! In 2014 he attended a service with “Kirche in Aktion” (literally ""Church in Action"") the Sunday after meeting some of their members at a nightclub and feeling like there was “something different” about them (side note - one of the guys there that night opened his own atelier as a gold smith and he is the one that made their wedding rings!). Robert heard a testimony that deeply moved him and he began to volunteer for the church. He was baptized in a pool at a church retreat and soon was asked about pursuing full-time ministry. He accepted the call and gave up his start-up company and other career options.When Krystal reflects on her life, she realizes in awe and wonder how gracious God has been:""I had always expected marriage to be around the corner for me and was a bit baffled as to why I was 40, pursuing what God had for me (which was first learning and living in a dynamic Christian community in Seattle and then being called to Portugal for ministry) and still single. I thought i would be ministering in Portugal for the rest of my life... until there were a series of events, including a dream that lead to a direct pointing of me attending the Church in Action new year’s retreat where He confirmed that i should move and work with Church in Action. It is also the retreat where Robert had been baptized 4 years earlier and as he had since become a city pastor with Kirche in Aktion, it is also where we met for the first time. My mom had spent my whole life praying for the person I would marry. After the new year’s party I returned home to the United States and in that short trip my mother was diagnosed with leukemia and after a long, but short 3 weeks she passed away. She never met the person I was to marry, but he and i had met each other before she went to heaven. We can’t help but wonder how much of us coming together is really a testimony to the power of prayer. The obvious way God led me to Church in Action meant I knew without doubt that despite wanting to stay and be near my dad and brother after my mom’s death I needed to continue with the move from Portugal to Germany. During the time i moved a group of pastors, including Robert, were finishing their masters thesis AND it just so happened that Robert was writing his about coffee shop ministry... which is exactly what I had been doing in Portugal for the last seven years! So, obviously, we needed to work together a bit and meet up often! Months later we started dating and here we are today, marrying on my mom’s birthday, which happens to fall on a Sunday this year - the day of the week I have dreamed of marrying. Is there more to this story? Obviously! I haven’t even mentioned Covid-19 and cultural things! But the biggest part of the story is how two people from across the globe, but built for each other, have been lured by the grace of God into each others lives after 40 years of life and what that might mean for the rest of their lives together!!! There is no reason to wait any longer!"

Newlywed,Andrew & Nisha Wedding Fund,"Framingham, MA",3716.0,5000.0,198,27,83,"My brother Andrew Ravesi met Nisha Patel back in 2015. Three years later he was proposing to her in the Boston Public Garden. They both began planning their big Indian wedding. They chose the International Golf Course in Bolton, Massachusetts as their wedding venue for its beautiful scenery of the outdoor golf courses and the reception room right on the property.Just 2 months before the wedding on May 30th, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Andrew and Nisha thought their wedding might possibly get postponed but hoped for the best. Outfits had been purchased and sewn. Invites had been sent out.Everything changed at the end of March when they found out from a news article that their wedding venue was closing down and would not be reopening after the pandemic. No one at the International Golf Course would answer phones or emails. Just radio silence. Then just last week the club filed for bankruptcy. After talking with attorneys and other couples who were to have their wedding at the International as well, Andrew and Nisha began to realize that they would not be seeing a penny back of the $10,000 they had already paid the club.Not only had they been saving this money for 2 years during their engagement, but everything had been planned. They have been robbed. And now the happiest day of what would be any couple’s life is ruined.I live with my brother Andrew and his fiancé Nisha. I have personally watched the toll this has taken on them. Neither of them even want a wedding anymore. This has left them both so incredibly sad and angry.I really hesitated even posting a fundraiser for them because I know everyone is really going through tough times during this pandemic. I know many people don’t have jobs or any extra money at the moment. That said, I’ve had numerous friends and family reach out wanting to help these two wonderful people and decided to create a formal way to do so for those that are able. Any money raised will be used for a small wedding at some point in the future if they decide to have one or for wedding gifts that would have been given had they had a wedding"

In the meantime, Rich, a carpenter, is working on constructing our home by creating two separate dwellings inside of his family's current house.  We are asking for your help to ensure the apartment construction is finished by the end of the year so we can live together as a married couple.BACKGROUNDIn the spring of 2019, Rich and his parents, Rich Sr. and Pam Feeley, purchased 3 acres in beautiful Chimacum, WA, along with a 2600 square foot house.  The plan all along was to divide the house into two separate living quarters - one for Pam and Rich and one to rent out to a prospective tenant. Then I (Jessica) walked into the picture! And plans changed. Now the apartment-to-be is where I will live and eventually where Rich and I will live. Right now Rich lives in his RV on the property he shares with his parents. I live in a cabin on Discovery Bay, about 20 minutes away.For many months, Rich has been steadily and singlehandedly working on the construction and remodeling job.  He is transforming the master bedroom and a spare bedroom into one self contained unit with a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and side room.  He is additionally transforming the former living room into his parents' new bedroom while also ripping out the carpet throughout the house and laying wooden floors. It really is a colossal job.Rich works full-time as a cashier at the Kearney co-op.  He also fulfills small carpentry jobs for community members. For example, he recently built a deck for a local couple.  This means that the time he has to work on our house is limited and every minute counts.  With the money we raise, we will purchase building materials and hire an assistant carpenter who could help Rich multiply his efforts, speed along the remodeling and transform the current house into a multi-generational dwelling.  After our wedding, Rich plans to dive into the house project in earnest. With help, we are hoping this work will take 3 more months - October, November and December - and be completed by the end of the year.To honor your generosity as our donors, we will create a plaque in our apartment with the names of every single person who contributes no matter how much.  This plaque will be a permanent fixture representing that you our friends and family made it possible for this dwelling to become our home. Every time we see it, we will be reminded that our relationship literally lives inside of the love of our community as our lives together evolve and flourish. Thank you in advance for your generous help!"
Newlywed,Holly and Natalie's Road Trip Honeymoon,"Brooklyn, NY",2920.0,500.0,140,18,7,"We were set to be married this summer, but due to the Covid, our wedding was cancelled.

Newlywed,Covid Ruined Their Wedding (several times),"Northfield, NJ",2880.0,10000.0,140,16,14,"I am sure I speak for everyone who knows them when I say that Kenny and Sam are two of the nicest people I know.  They are kind, generous, empathetic, loving, hilarious, patient, etc. (the list could go on forever).  Sam a teacher and Kenny a teacher's aid for children with special needs, both with huge hearts that deserve nothing but the best.  For the past year and a half, they had been planning the wedding that they both dreamed of having.  Both coming from large families, they looked forward to their big day to celebrate their love for one another and their families.  The original wedding date was set for late March 2020 and everything was planned perfectly for their big day until they received the devastating news that Covid-19 restrictions would prevent them from having their special day as planned.  However, Kenny and Sam being the eternal optimists wouldn't let this news derail their desire to celebrate their love.  So after countless efforts to reschedule the venue, vendors, finding new vendors, losing deposits with other vendors, etc. they tentatively planned a new date for Memorial Day Weekend, with the hope that everything would work itself out.  After weeks of waiting to see if things would work out, they didn't want to risk it so they were able to once again reschedule everything for July 11th.  While restricted to the number of guests, outside seating, etc. they didn't have a choice but to roll with the punches and make the best of it. Anybody who has ever been part of a wedding knows how stressful it can be right up until that big day.  This brings us to today July 8th, 3 days before their big day and I received the most heartbreaking phone call from Kenny that he just found out he tested positive for Covid and the wedding once again needs to be canceled until further notice.  I have always considered Kenny the little brother I never had and while feeling helpless, with my heartbreaking for the two of them, this was the only thing I could think of that would potentially soften the blow for the both of them.  Covid-19 is something that doesn't appear to going away anytime soon, so if you have not been impacted personally with someone extremely close to you, I am sure it is a matter of time.  So I am asking those of you who see this to pay it forward and contribute what you can, so that after all of the stress, money lost, anxiety, tears, and Covid passes, these two can eventually start their life together that they both deserve."
Newlywed,New Car,"Asheville, NC",2875.0,10000.0,107,16,0,"Hello loved ones! So many of you have asked about a registry since we got married on March 22, 2019. We had planned to put one together before our celebration on Bowen’s Island in September, which we sadly had to cancel due to the pandemic. 

We are asking that in lieu of wedding gifts that you would consider donating so we can make a second car a reality. We truly have all we need in the household department, and a honeymoon doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon with the way the world is. The pandemic has shook us all to the core and we would love folks’ support in helping us build our future here on the east coast."

Newlywed,Neanna and Jason's Frito Pie Fueled Honeymoon,"Austin, TX",2800.0,3500.0,150,18,11,"Frito pie!! New Mexicans think it was invented in Santa Fe; Texans, in San Antonio. When Anthony Bourdain calls it “warm crap in a bag,” who should be insulted? Jason and I vow to get to the bottom of one of the biggest mysteries of the universe and we’d like your help. On August 1st we will bravely embark upon a journey across a new world. A world that at times will be unwelcome to strangers and will close their doors on us. But we won’t give up! We’ll travel far and wide to bring back the answers we all deserve. We've saved some money for this quest but need your help to take us all the way. With your modest donation we'll be able to purchase new gear to sustain ourselves and both literal and metaphorical fuel for our journey. SO HERE'S THE TRUTH.... I absolutely LOVE Frito pie. I’m Texan, its in my blood. It's the only reason I ever attended a football game in high school. And while I wouldn’t mind knowing it's history, the reality is that it was invented and we all get to enjoy it, and thats all that matters. More than finding out answers to questions that don’t matter,  I’d really love for Jason and I to get to take whatever honeymoon we can as newlyweds. A road trip honeymoon wasn’t what we’d planned on, but we know we can turn it into something truly special and memorable. And while we didn’t get to have our wedding at Basecamp 37 this year we are still going there in August to work for a few weeks. We'd like to turn the drive there and the drive back into the best mini moon we can! We aren’t seeking to lavish ourselves at restaurants or stay in fancy resorts with couples massages. As you all know we prefer to camp under the stars and cook each other dinner. We’d love your help acquiring some new gear for the trip (like a new tent, a portable stove and camp cooking stuff, a roof cargo box to put all that stuff in, and new bad ass tires for our truck so we can go drive on all the crazy roads) and generally to just help alleviate the stress of spending money on something that, especially given the worlds climate, we absolutely know is not a necessity, but is instead a desire. We know times are tough for everyone. Most of you, like us, haven’t had jobs or income in months.  And most of you, like us, have donated what little you do have to reparations and mutual aid. We’re not asking for much, truly whatever you’re able and willing to give would be greatly appreciated. We won't any point be having a traditional registry, so apart from joining us next summer for our celebration this will be the only gift we would like to ask for. And any extra funds we have will go towards that celebration!  And if you can’t donate money to our cause that's totally ok! We’ll gladly accept a playlist from you to accompany us on our journey. Jason can’t sing the whole time and there are only so many episodes of true crime podcasts one can listen to. We love you dearly and cannot wait to celebrate our love for each other and for you next summer in the desert. And lastly we promise, that we WILL have Frito pie both on our honeymoon AND at our celebration with you in Utah. All our love, Neanna & Jason"
Newlywed,Luciana´s Immigration Fund,"Atlanta, GA",2750.0,4250.0,108,25,128,"We are raising money to pay for the Luciana´s immigration process which requires a lawyer and several expensive applications in order to complete so that she will have the opportunity to stay in the United States and continue creating and moving as she pleases. We got married in celebration of the love we have for one another but that was only part of the process. Now, we are engaged in a long and complicated legal journey that costs over 4,000 dollars to complete. Luciana does not have the right to work in the United States with her current legal status, which makes it  harder for her to get the money together for this process. We are currently vulnerable to be separated by ICE enforcement agents or immigration police right now while her VISA status remains unchanged. This causes a lot of anxiety for us, as the life we are making could be destroyed and Luciana's living situation could change dramatically without notice. We also cannot fly within the country with this situation. Unfortunately, between us, we do not have the money to pay for this right now.  We want to resolve this as fast as possible. Luciana has many artistic collaborations that she is excited to explore in Atlanta, as well as her partnership and friendships with the people she has gotten close to here. We want to make it possible for her to live in peace and have the rights necessary to be successful. Below, is a link to a performance that we did called ´Mating Dance´in which we danced in celebration of our love inspired by the mating rituals of animals and insects. Watch if you would like. https://youtu.be/6ENBGKNSjJUIf you donate more than $500, we would like to extend the opportunity to you for us to come and do a private performance for you in a locale of your choosing. If you donate more than $250, we will send you our most recent Osos Peligrosos recording which is in the process of being edited called ´Haxan.´ We will also send a small visual arts collaboration that we make together for you if you would like.Thank you so much for your time and support. We love you,Besos Rafa y Luci"

I am in a loving committed relationship with my partner, Patrick. We would like to get married so Patrick can legally speak for me when the time comes when I can't make my own healthcare choices, like life support. But more important to me is that our souls will forever be linked for eternity. Patrick and I have seen a 70+ percent loss of income due to the pandemic and can't afford a wedding. We would like to drive to Las Vegas and get married in a civil ceremony and spend the weekend. We'd like to elope on Halloween, so we need to raise money as soon as possible to make this happen. I have never been one to ask for help or even admit that I need help, but any love and support you can give us will make our miracle happen. See, at a time in my life when I am facing my own mortality and a very unpleasant death from cancer, I wake up every day grateful because Patrick fills  my every moment with love and support and because of him I will not have to face this alone. This money will cover our food, transportation, hotel, the wedding ceremony, and the $77. license fee. And it will make our dream a reality.

Newlywed,Mackenzie and Morgan’s happiest ever after,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",2230.0,10000.0,136,6,0,"We came into 2020 planning our beautiful wedding for the fall.  Little did we know COVID-19 would rearrange our plans entirely.  We had to come to a hard decision to postpone our wedding because we did not want family from around the country to chance their health.  Sadden as we were we just decided to put it on the back burner for the foreseeable future.

THEN, our beautiful friends at Phocus Photography invited us to be models for their wedding editorial shoot they were planning.  Jokingly,  Mackenzie said “shoot can you just marry us then.” And they went full steam ahead.  We eloped at a beautiful venue with zebras, peacocks and kangaroos in the background. Mackenzie got to pick out a beautiful dream dress that would have been out of our original budget.  I got a to wear an awesome tux along with some groovy shoes.  Not to mention the flowers were something from a dream and partnered with all the rentals(arbors, chairs etc).  It was seriously beautiful. We have said many times it was our dream day minus our loved ones. May 18, 2020 was a day that we will both treasure.  We have been overwhelmed with the amount of love and congratulations we have received.  We realized we have not even thought about or begun to execute a wedding registry until many people asked. In saying this, we would greatly appreciate any monetary gifts. We dont know what the future holds and to be honest this little 2 bedroom apartment is busting at the seams.Again, thank you to everyone who has taken the time to wish us well on our new beautiful chapter.

COVID move aside, here we come. We are making lemonade out of lemons and doing a true Millennial wedding. We are ZOOMING IT!!!! What is ESPECIALLY wonderful about our virtual global wedding is that ALL of you can join US, no matter how many thousands of miles away you may live.  And you can be with us EVERYWHERE we go as bride and groom, not just the ceremony and reception. We have created this GoFundMe page instead of a wedding registry.  We have everything we need in the way of typical home furnishing and such. Instead we would ask for your gifts as a contribution towards our small wedding, future honeymoon and to help mitigate some financial challenges created by the crisis.  The requested goal amount is our estimated need over the next year. We thank you for any gift amount within your means and we hope you will be able to attend our beautiful and very special virtual wedding Friday, August 7, 2020.Love Truly, Guille and Emily"

As more time passed and nothing seemed to change, they knew they had to make a heartbreaking decision to delay the wedding.As they have been making payments for the wedding by themselves with the support of love and time from family, Tori and Anthony have been strategic and careful about each detail of their wedding.  Because they changed the date, a vendor has now requested thousands in re-booking fees and required the couple to pay up front, now, rather than spread out up until 30 days before the wedding.  This is the last obstacle they should have to worry about during this already incredibly difficult time.  Those who love Tori and Anthony want them to be able to create memories during a day that is supposed to be filled with joy, laughter, and happy tears.  Lately, it has caused tears for all the wrong reasons, and we want to take some of the stress off of their shoulders.  Please consider helping Tori and Anthony find the magic in their day again!"

Sports,Camp Deerhorn 2020 Fund,"Winnetka, IL",94200.0,250000.0,171,190,639,"We are past and present families of Deerhorn Campers.To preserve the gifts that Deerhorn has brought to thousands of Boys, over 90 years of camping in the woods of Rhinelander Wisconsin, we are asking for your support. We want to see generations of boys continue to make Deerhorn their summer destination. Without these funds, this may not happen, so our ask is genuine and it touches each and every one of us. In response to COVID-19 and the necessary closing down of Summer 2020 Camp Deerhorn sessions, the Broadbridge families are practicing what they have always preached to our sons; ""to try to see the other fellow's side of the question...” To demonstrate this, Deerhorn has offered families that could not donate their 2020 deposit the option to roll-over, or request an eventual refund of these funds. This promise is outside the terms we all agree to when we complete our annual application for camp. Deerhorn relies on these deposits for fixed costs that the camp incurs year after year. These costs have not vanished, even though Summer 2020 will not happen. Refunds create a shortfall today and roll-overs will merely push Deerhorn’s shortfall until 2021. We don't feel that Deerhorn, nor the Broadbridge families should bear this burden alone.We are all in this together! So, we would like to ask the families that can; Help us make up this difference.  Whether your son is a current, past, or even, in-waiting camper, please consider supporting this fundraiser. This Go Fund Me campaign is for all Deerhorn families, including the family that has done so much to develop our sons into Boys and Men of character, resilience, and leadership. Deerhorn will receive these funds directly through an account set up on their behalf via GoFundMe and will use these funds to support all requests for refunds. These are unprecedented times, and we know that many of our fellow Deerhorn families may also be facing significant challenges. If you are unable to help through a donation of your own, we appreciate you taking the time to read this page. We ask you to consider passing the link on to others who might be willing to help. Anyone who knows your son and values the person he is becoming may be willing to stand with your son and donate even a small amount to help us meet this challenge.  Gratefully, Current and Past Families of Deerhorn Campers"
Sports,Rise Up - World Martial Arts Center Fundraiser,"Brooklyn, NY",120640.0,200000.0,84,477,626,"The picture Included here is a prime example of not only what Sabumnim stands for, but why my wife and I KNEW this was the school and the Master with whom my son should begin his martial arts journey with. My son was given a citizenship award at school and Sabumnim was so emphatic about the fact that it should be celebrated even though my son hadn’t mentioned it during the dojang afterschool program.Prior to joining WMAC, I had reached out to a few schools when my son was 4 and a half years old, and they all said that they didn’t start training children that early. Undaunted, I came to WMAC. I’ll never forget the day in 2015 when I came to the dojang on a Saturday afternoon and Sabumnim was just about to leave. We talked for about 45 minutes.I expressed my desire to have my son start training early, as I wished I  had, and how important it was for young Black boys to develop not just martial arts training but the discipline, awareness, and sensitivity to equip themselves for the unique challenges they would face. We were speaking each other’s language as Brooklyn-bred men of color. I knew this was the place for us. To my joy and surprise, the diversity of dojang students and instructors was more than I ever expected. The adaptation to needs, skill sets, and particular challenges has been a blessing and a joy. The Chungsanims even motivated me to get back to my own training regardless of my physical challenges (which had been my personal crutch for years). I can’t for a minute imagine what we would do without WMAC, Sabumnim and the community. #Lifechanging #necessary #cantdowithout  -Kurt

The World Martial Arts Center started over 30 years ago to teach self-defense and empower women. Seeing the rapid skill development of these women, the men around them were inspired to join us. Since that time, many of the members have gotten married and had children and we created a children's program that has grown to a seven day a week program, with an emphasis on self-esteem, self-image, self-respect and self-confidence. WMAC has received seven prestigious national top ten martial arts school awards and besides having 60% female instructors, it is one of the few schools in New York City to produce women masters in traditional Korean Hapkido and VSK Combat Street Jujitsu.This is a place where families train together, little boys learn to respect and value little girls as their equal. And little girls learn to hold their own, with complete confidence amongst any group of boys. At our school, we build character and teens respect and admire their parents.WMAC is an empowerment generating force in the community for men, women and children regardless of socio-economic backgrounds. It is a place where Black Lives Matter, where a Hasidic Jew, Egyptian Muslim, a Chinese Buddhist and an Irish Catholic can train together and bond as brothers and sisters of the human family tree. The pandemic has decimated seventy percent of our student body which has made it impossible for us to maintain and operate our school. We are forced to leave our present location and we need your help to establish a new location and save our school. For the first time in 30 years a school that was started with $38 and no bank loans, that not only thrived but supported countless others in fulfilling their goals and life dreams, and has reached down to lift so many up now is reaching up for a hand to pull them back onto solid high ground so that we can continue being a true force for good for humanity.This is an urgent and time sensitive appeal to save our school and maintain a place of empowerment for all in these disempowering times.Your donation means so much to us and as a thank you,If you donate $50 or more you get access to a virtual beginners' guide which includes the complete beginners' program $100 or more you get access to the virtual beginners' guide  and the 12 guided meditations $500 or more you get all of the above plus exclusive access to a special, live, virtual weapon training with the Grandmaster (includes five preparation videos prior to the workshop)"

We are thankful no injuries occurred, but devastated at the loss of something that helped make the Xi Delta Chapter so special. We are exploring an effort rebuild our barn, but need your help.  As this recently happened, our plans to rebuild are not finalized and no decisions have been made. When they are, the fundraising goal will be adjusted to match what we need. What is clear is that our insurance policy will not be enough to rebuild the barn. The initial goal limit is based on our preliminary expectation of the cost. The housing corporation has not made any decisions on designs of a potential future structure.For 30 years, the Chi Phi barn has been a place for people to come together. We have used it to relax on a weekend; we have used it to bring countless Brothers into our family; we have used the barn to mourn the loss of Brothers no longer with us. We have also used the  barn to welcome thousands of friends into our home. Chi Phi Chapters across Florida and Brothers across the country have visited throughout the years. Some have stayed with us during summers, and they have left with lifelong friendships. We have hosted every Fraternity and Sorority at Florida Tech for one reason or another. For the past 30 years, we have opened our doors to you to celebrate a holiday or to toast to all of our successes after a semester, or even to sit under the shade and enjoy a beautiful day. The Chi Phi barn sat at our house, but it has lived in the hearts and memories of so many of us.I’m sure many of you have some great memory of a time around our barn. Maybe you heard a song that you couldn’t resist dancing to, or a game that you won and still talk about with old friends. The barn could have been the place where you met someone you’ll never forget, or it could have been the place where you fell in love. We ask that you think about what the barn has given you. We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has put many people in a less secure financial state. We ask, if you are able to do so, that you donate to help in our efforts so that thousands more can experience everything that you have, too.Any money donated through GoFundMe will go directly to funding the barn exploratory project and will not be tax-deductible.Fraternally, The Executive Boards of XDHC and XDAAThe Xi Delta Housing Corporation (XDHC) is an organization run solely by elected alumni of the Xi Delta Chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity located in Melbourne, FL. All donations will go to XDHC in an effort to explore what future structure could replace the barn. This would eventually include construction costs for a new structure. The fundraiser's donations will be directly withdrawn by the intended recipient."
Sports,"Balance Bicycle Shop Rebuilding, Richmond VA","Richmond, VA",45095.0,45000.0,177,751,2.5K,"My name is Greg Milefsky, I am the owner of Balance Bicycle Shop. On May 30, we were the victims of vandalism and complete and total looting as a result of the riots on Broad St., the stretch of Broad St. where my shop is located. Our entire inventory was looted to include all but one of our customers bikes that were in for service (no, it's not your bike. The owner has been notified.) This includes every single wheel and small item that was brought in for service.Before going a sentence further, I must say that on May 30, 2020 I was able to come home to my kids. They came into my bed with me as I laid awake. My sister came to my house just to provide support. George Floyd would never see his kids again and his sister again. And I can't even think about this without crying. He never went home and I did. I need a moment of silence.I have been overwhelmed with support, which is amazing. Many people have offered financial support, so I made this is the GoFundMe for Balance Bicycle Shop. But don't donate to me, GoFund George Floyd and his family instead. I went home to my family and he didn't.https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloydBut, if you still want to give to Balance Bicycle Shop, know I am truly grateful. I am actually overwhelmed by emails, text messages, DMs, right now. The generosity of people who I know and love already and the cycling community in Richmond would be enough. But there is an additional outpouring of support from people who I don't know, who I have never met, who have never been in my shop, and who don't even live in Virginia. All of it is humbling.I want give a rough guidelines for what I plan do use your donations for, and the ways your donations will be used to help rebuild Balance Bicycle Shop.10% will go to Richmond Cycling Corps. They do amazing work with at risk youth in Richmond, using cycling as the tool to break down the barriers.  There is nothing more that I can say that hasn't been said or done through their work.  https://www.richmondcyclingcorps.org/Phase 1 rebuilding will start with making my existing customers who have lost their bikes in the looting whole again. Going forward, I am working with our insurance to cover customer's losses. This will take time as we get all the relevant and necessary documents. I hope to build a fund to make my customers whole and repay their loses quicker than insurance. This is Phase 1 in rebuilding, making sure my existing customers are taken care of.Phase 2 rebuilding will be to pay my employees who have no jobs now. My employees are unemployed as a result of the looting. Some of my employees have been with me for years. There is no set length of time for which I want to be able to pay them, but anything will help in a time like this.Next is Phase 3a or Phase 3b. These are speculative because they exist many months into the future. Only one scenario will prevail, and I don't know which one it will be.Phase 3a is actual rebuilding; inventory, cabinets, computers, fixtures, etc. Financially, this will largely be taken care of by insurance. It will take time, effort, man-hours and it will be a fraction of the actual loss in dollar amounts and time. I expect this insurance claim will take 12-18mo.We will not reopen in Richmond City. I can't rebuild in Richmond City. Justifiable rising tensions makes it impossible to rebuild in Richmond City. Police brutality and racism is not going anywhere and the escalating violence and tension in the city make it no longer viable for businesses. Maybe I can rebuild once, but impossible twice. It absolutely pains me to say, but the next murder of an unarmed black person is guaranteed, we just don't know who it is yet. I can't spend the next 6 months of my life rebuilding my business only to get looted again for something I have absolutely no control over.Phase 3b is the end of Balance Bicycle Shop. What happened, the looting, is not just a break-in where we lost a few bikes and otherwise able to resume business in a day or two. This is the complete gutting of my businesses inventory, tools, which we truly can't restock because of supply chain shortages. There is nothing left. We can't resume normal business before the money runs out.  UPDATE: This option was always a last resort but I wanted to be clear it was possible before money was donated.  Based on the response I've gotten from GoFundMe and through other channels, this is not an option.  Rebuilding Balance Bicycle Shop will be the way forward."

The PPP loan we received went only so far and came with heavy restrictions, making it a temporary boost but not a salvation.Even into the fifth month of the shutdown, there are expenses we are obligated to pay. Furthermore, there are things we are unwilling to do to survive.-We are obligated to pay rent of almost $23,000 each month.-We are unwilling to stop paying the furloughed staff’s healthcare premiums that come to $6,500 monthly.-We are obligated to pay other bills which, after reducing by half, amount to $15,000 each month.-We are unwilling to spend money that has been paid to us for services we were not able to render, which means a fair bit of our bank balance is in reserve.We have exhausted our options and are now appealing to our community for help.

Additionally, 35% percent of black households do not have access to Internet. Digital literacy is also an issue in these communities. How can an individual look for a job, complete online course work satisfactorily if they do not fully understand how to utilize technology?The Hidden Genius Project is one of those organizations. Through their 15-month Immersion and Catalyst programs, they train and mentor black male youth in technology creation, entrepreneurship and leadership skills to transform their lives and communities. Together, we can do our part to help close this digital divide by raising money to donate to this great cause.The donations collected during this fundraiser will go to ""Investing in the Genius Alumni Network "" including the following:–Workforce Developer: Support internships and workforce development opportunities for Geniuses–College Access Sponsor: Support coaching, staff training, and technology costs to serve at least 150 unique Genius alumni, with multiple years of support per GeniusWhat Next?Donate.

You’re certain to see familiar faces working behind front desk, year after year. For the past 6 months we have been holding onto hope for a future in the same Silver Lake neighborhood that we’ve been rooted in for 42 years. Covid-19 has impacted our family business, like many small businesses, and forced us to face dark times.When Covid-19 halted life as we know it this past March, BBG was hit especially hard; fitness facilities have become a forgotten industry. We are limited by our indoor space and furthermore, have been offered no rent forgiveness or reduction. Given the costs of maintaining a business (rent, business taxes, insurances, utilites, etc.) while being forcibly closed, there is no guarantee when or if BBG will be able to reopen without your help.Over the years, the neighborhood has changed - gone are many of the long standing businesses that once called Silver Lake their home. We have a long history in our community and through the tough times, we’ve remained standing - always finding a way to come back stronger than before thanks to the support of our members. There’s never been a doubt that we could weather whatever life presented to us. So, to all of the past and present members, and to communities both near and far, we say this: The entire BBG Family would be eternally grateful for any support that you can give.We love you.

We are in a tough battle and doing everything we can to reopen when allowed, and be even better than before.A little over a month ago was our 25 year anniversary being in business. Instead of celebrating, we had to inform our members that we will be closing until the Governor decides we can reopen. We will be approaching 60 days of almost zero revenue, like many other small businesses.We respect many of the decisions made to keep us all safe and healthy, however, that has put major damage on the business. Many members have offered to continue paying their monthly dues. We will not forget the kind gestures but felt it was not the right thing to do at the time.Going forward, we are headed into some of the toughest challenges. But we have been dragged into deep waters plenty of times. Unfortunately, we were shut down with very little assistance to continue operating when we are allowed to reopen.We understand that we are all struggling, and only ask for donations for those who can afford to do so. Most of the donations will be used towards the high sanitary expectations and cleaning products to keep our gym even cleaner than it was. And so our members have reassurance that we care for their health and safety.We thank you all for the last 25 years and we hope to see another 25 more. And let's keep creating world champions!And if you cannot donate, we understand but please share this! Stay Safe and God Bless!"

His experience is deep, his teaching is inspired, his ability to motivate will move you and the community he and Saundra have built is friendly and supportive. And, they've put everything they have into the Camp.Friday May 1, 2020 they sent out an announcement they were permanently closed due to the overwhelming expenses they are facing and their decision to not charge membership dues while we can't train.Many of us think we should chip it to preserve the Camp so he's still in NYC when this is over and we can get back to training.Understanding that everyone is effected differently by this situation - particularly the economic impact many are experiencing, those who have the ability can help support Coban & Saundra by donating 1-2 months dues (or whatever you can) to keep them in NYC and in business.And, if we fail at funding and enticing them to stay in NYC, at the very least they won't walk away with the financial burden with which they are currently saddled.I can tell you on a personal note that Marco and I went to see them yesterday and they were pretty frustrated by their predicament."

Our programs provide individuals of all backgrounds opportunities to enjoy world-class tuition and personal development, with coaches drawn from all around the world, many of whom have participated and won with numerous Olympian, Junior-Olympian, Pan-American and National teams. No child that wants to fence is ever turned away because of a lack of funds. Similarly, we provide and maintain all equipment without charge, and offer numerous scholarships to those in need.BHFC has unfortunately had to temporarily close in light of COVID-19 and proper practice of Social Distancing. The health of our members and their families is of the utmost importance to us, but naturally this comes at a cost. We cannot thank our members who have rallied around us and maintained their memberships enough. But unfortunately, without the ability to offer classes, we're not quite able to meet our monthly costs.This means we must turn to our friends and the public to ask for help. We need at least $25,000, to be used solely for our rent and utilities alone over the summer period. This will ensure we're still here to serve our community once we can re-open, and continue providing fulfilling, life-affirming experiences through fencing at BHFC for years to come.Thank you for any and all support.Margo Miller, Founder and Carla Corbit, Head Coach._____________________________________________________________________Some stories from our Members:Cameron G.Beverly Hills fencers' club has been a second home since I was 11. Not only have I grown as a fencer, but I have grown up there. They have hosted birthday parties, halloween and holiday parties, they are a staple in the community. The fundamental values that are taught at the club are the same that I hold close to my heart. BHFC is an extraordinary place and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it. It is not just a fencing club, it is a family and ultimately an integral part of a community. BHFC is a safe haven for me. I was able to leave my problems at the door because of the safe and caring community Carla and Margo cultivated. It is genuinely unlike any place I know.  It is such a special place to me and I want as many people as possible to experience it.  BHFC is a special place to donate to help through these hard times. Roberto A. Parent""My Daughter joined the Beverly Hills Fencing Club just a little over a year ago, and I can honestly say that the changes and growth I have seen in her are remarkable. She has embraced the sport, with all the rigor and discipline that it requires, with passion. I never thought I would see this, but she can barely wait for her classes to re-start; she is very anxious to get back in the game. I’d like to thank the staff of the BHFC, and in particular coaches Carla and Margo, for taking my kid under their wings and shaping her into what she hopes to become, a future U.S.A. Olympian.""Camille G. 2010 ""BHFC is more than just a fencing club. It changed my life. No, really. I began fencing at BHFC when I was 14 years old, and in the fencing world, that is a bit old to start to fence competitively. However, I found a family in BHFC; my coaches Carla Corbit and Margo Miller taught me life lessons and values, beyond the sport of fencing, such as discipline, integrity, and commitment. They pushed and supported me to reach my best, not only in the sport but in life. Their guidance together with my dedication led to becoming a US Squad member, representing the US in World Championships around the globe, and then ultimately, being recruited to fence in the Ivy Leagues, becoming a Columbia University Lion. I am grateful for my mother who brought me to BHFC and stuck it out with me through each tournament and even more so to Carla and Margo for all their years of being there.""Seven A. 2022""The Beverly Hills Fencing Club has become my second home. My coaches Carla and Margo have become my mentors. Fencing has turned out to be my biggest passion in life, and interesting enough I found it at a time where I thought I’d never find something to be truly passionate about and invested in. Now, the highlight of my day is being able to fence against my teammates and friends at the club, people who I consider family. BHFC is a place that helps me to pursue my dream.""JoLynn S. Parent""We all made lasting friendships with fencers, their parents, and the dedicated and wonderful coaches – Carla, Margo, and Ted. This is more than a fencing club –they are family, spending time together during the holidays and travelling together. It is so important that we continue to support places like this that foster a sense of achievement, confidence and security for our kids. I am going to and I hope you do too. This could not be more worth your time and resources. We love them!""Louie K. 2019 ""Fencing has taught me so many things and has contributed in so many ways to who I am today. At fencing tournaments and club practices, I learned and felt camaraderie and team spirit. Although I sometimes wasn't able to make it out to the club some weeks, fencing was a pillar of my education.""Erika A. Parent""We are so fortunate to have Beverly Hills Fencing Club.  Margo and Carla are truly the most dedicated and generous coaches.  I have watched my daughter as well as many other students train vigorously and they have indeed reaped the rewards for their hard work.  But most importantly, my daughter has had the opportunity to have two amazing women as her mentors. WE LOVE BHFC and my daughter is beyond eager to get back to training. ""Gabrielle M.""BHFC is an amazing community full of dedicated fencers and coaches. Not only was I taught by some of the best in the business, but I truly felt that I was part of the family.""Mary Ellen G. Adult Fencer ""When I met fencing coach Carla Corbit almost 20 years ago, I hadn’t fenced since my old college days some 20 years earlier. I took my first free introductory lesson and was hooked! As a result, I have been a long time fencer, friend and supporter of BHFC because I have witnessed firsthand how important fencing is for building confidence, character, self discipline, and sportsmanship in fencers of all ages. Many of the kids I first fenced, have since graduated from college and have become successful young adults, partly due to coach Carla Corbit’s dedication to her students and to the fine art of fencing. May the Beverly Hills Fencers Club continue to thrive and perpetuate the exciting and exhilarating sport of fencing. Please help support this truly amazing organization because we love fencing and Coach Carla!""Matthew L. 2021""Fencing has been a huge part of my teenage life and I have made so many incredible friends through the sport. My life would be very different without it!""Patrick L.""It’s been great working with Carla and Margo over the years at the Beverly Hills Fencing Club. A big thanks to them for Introducing my son and I to the fencing Community. Their enthusiasm is infectious and their expertise and knowledge about fencing is amazing. I will be forever grateful for the positive influences and leadership opportunities they afforded my son. It would be a shame to let this community asset disappear. My best wishes in their survival during these challenging times.""Ken & Teresa Parents""BHFC has become like a second family for our daughter where she’s learned fundamental elements of fencing and fencing competition from amazing instructors who are truly invested in each student’s personal growth and development. Just as importantly, the club emphasizes camaraderie, the benefits of hard work, and inclusion."""

It pains me to share, that this is one of those difficult times...One of our fellow Weston Eagles players, David Granger, has lost both parents at the young age of 12. He lost his mother, Carol, to breast cancer after he concluded his 2nd grade year. A few weeks ago, his father, Adam, lost his battle with cancer as well. As if the agony of losing both parents isn’t more than what any child should bear, David’s paternal grandmother, who he had great affection for, passed away one week before his father.Adam and David were always huge baseball fans and they shared a father-son bond through this beloved sport. David is a talented ball player with an exceptional baseball IQ and sincere love for the comradery the sport provides. His smile, upbeat spirit, and personality are contagious. It is unfathomable that he has lost both of his parents and grandmother at such a young age.Before David’s father, passed away, he prepared for his son’s life by asking his best friend’s family if they would care for David - and this amazing family has taken on this incredible responsibility with love and joy.David and his chocolate Labrador Winston moved in with Hudson Houmes who has been his best friend since 2nd grade. David now lives with Hudson, his sister Crosby, and their parents, Ashley and Matt (and their 2 dogs) :)They are in need of any help our Eagles family can provide. They are doing their best to make changes to their home to help David feel welcomed and equally a part of their family. We are humbly asking for monetary donations that will go directly to the Houmes family to help support David during this difficult and transitional time.If your heart leads you to do so, please make a donation to this incredible family. Please reshare his story and his gofundme page so others can contribute if they desire.Thank you in advance for your love, kindness, and generosity.

Thank you everyone who shared our story or contributed financially to our cause. We are humbled by the amount of support that we received. We believe that we have enough funds to reopen on January 4th, 2020.Phase 2: Goal $100K - Stay Open Campaign: Current to March 31st, 2021 - Due to the challenges in the gymnastics industry, over 100 gyms, nationwide, have closed within the past 3 months. These funds will help ensure that Twisters can survive and then thrive during these uncertain times.FACTS ABOUT TWISTERS- WE ARE THE OLDEST RUNNING GYMNASTICS PROGRAM IN THE SOUTH BAY- WE HAVE PROVIDED SPORTS INSTRUCTION TO KIDS FOR 53 YEARS- WE NEED YOUR HELP TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE Dear Twisters' Members, Past Members, and Community,     Since 1967, Twisters Gymnastics, Inc. has provided the Santa Clara County community with youth sports instruction, after school care, and entertainment in a family setting. Throughout its 53 years of existence, Twisters has created a local reputation for providing quality instruction while maintaining a culture that stresses love of sport, a growth mindset, and community.     Unfortunately, after seven months of being unable to operate at a sustainable level, Twisters is at risk of becoming another statistic of the Covid-19 Pandemic. During the first few months, we received a lot of financial support from many of you via Zoom classes and voluntary membership payments. We truly appreciate and will never forget everyone's support during that time. During that time, Twisters also obtained a SBA PPP Loan to stay afloat and to keep key staff members employed. However, this loan will be depleted by the end of October 2020.     Currently, Twisters is in the process of relocating to 2800 Bowers Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95051. Unfortunately, delays within the Santa Clara City Planning Department due to the pandemic and the costs associated with engineering, architectural, and permitting fees have depleted our reserves. As many of you know, it takes a lot of capital to relocate and Twisters currently owes $7,500 in Architectural Services, $1,500 for City Permitting Fees, and $1,000 for Engineering Services. These are costs that are due before the Tenant Improvement (TI) process. Additionally, we've estimated that the facility set up will cost approximately $7,500 - $10,000. Fortunately, our new landlord has agreed to install an in-the-ground pit and undertake the major tenant improvements for us. The estimated date of completion for these improvements is November 30th, 2020.      Hopefully, at the end of this process, our intention is to reopen on Monday, January 4th, 2021. We also have plans to dissolve Twisters' current S Corporation status and create a ""new"" 501c3 nonprofit organization for Twisters to operate under. It seems to be a more suitable fit for how Twisters operates and is consistent with our community's values. If the Federal Government is unable to provide future relief for struggling businesses through a second stimulus package, then a Phase 2 Campaign will be created in order to stay open while a vaccine is developed and occupancy restrictions are lifted. Currently, a 25% occupancy limit is tough to operate under for any business.  

     On a personal level, our daughter, Remi Fusilero (11), has a dream to compete at the Elite Level and earn a college scholarship. We believe that she has the talent to accomplish both. Our dream is to accompany her throughout this process and to guide her with methods that are based upon the positive aspects of our sport.     If we’re blessed and fortunate to continue this journey, Remi and I will continue to serve our community through our Facebook Page, ""Allan and Remi Fusilero's Gymnastics Drills and Personal Favorites"" by posting our favorite drills, our drills, training methods, and philosophy. We'll also share her progress throughout her career. It'll be quite interesting to see if she achieves her goals and where this journey takes her.     Please help Twisters and our community continue its journey by sharing this request. We're not asking for big donations from a few, but hopefully, small donations from many. I’ve always believed that every successful endeavor is the sum of many small triumphs. We are hopeful that this can be one of those times.     Our ownership of Twisters has been a journey that we've been extremely proud of over the past 15 years and one that I know represents the Gymnastics Community with integrity, passion, and honor. We'd love to see it continue. Thank you for your time and consideration. Go Twisters 2020 and ""hopefully"" beyond.We would love to ""turn the lights back on"".

Throughout my Judo experience of 34 years, never have I been in such a situation. My Judo students consist of 80 members at the dojo, 250 students at the University of Central Florida and approximately 30 youth individuals who are of special needs. As a former professional athlete and a current instructor it’s been very difficult being away from my students. I truly feel that I was born to do this job and teaching my students is my life’s work. I simply don’t know what I would do if I was unable to have my students, who I have grown very close to and love like family. Rather than discontinue instruction to my students, I have utilized video conferencing tools such as ZOOM for my students and provided live sessions via Facebook/Instagram for the judo community free of charge. However, like any other small business owner and a family man, some level of income is required. Otherwise my dojo, my family, and the programs provided to the judo community will no longer be a reality. If my virtual sessions continue at zero charge to the public, it will cause great financial difficulty to my family and deplete all of my financial resources. On the contrary, if a decision is made to collect payments from individuals, a large number of judoka will not have the financial resources to participate due to all of us being effected by Covid-19.In order to prevent having to close the dojo and continue providing Virtual Judo Sessions to the public free of charge, the support of the global judo community is a necessity.  In such regards, I have started Crowd Funding in order to hold my dojo over until this pandemic comes to a conclusion. Without the generous support of friends and family of the judo community, my teachings to the dojo students, the university students, students of special needs, and the individuals participating in the virtual classes will cease to exist.  Therefore, I am asking for everyone’s support in order to continue to serve the Judoka community and allow my judo teachings to continue.We thank you for your kind consideration.Your Judo Friend,Shinjiro SasakiIf you would like to learn more about our dojo, my story and how I got here, please take a couple minutes and watch this video. Thank you so much! Here is a video of some of the work we're doing with University of Central Florida.We made the news!! 初めまして、アメリカ合衆国フロリダ州オーランドで柔道の道場を開いている佐々木伸次朗と申します。COVID-19の影響はここフロリダ州においても厳しく、不要不急の事態以外には外出が禁止されています。34年間柔道をしていますが、こんなに練習ができない状況は初めてです。　私には道場生が約80人、大学の授業を履修する生徒が年間約250人、スペシャルニーズ（自閉症と発達障害の子供達を対象にした）の子供達9歳から18歳を対象とした柔道のプログラムに参加している子供達が約30人います。しかし生徒達と会うこともできず、当然ですが稽古することもままならず、苦しく切ない日々が続いております。しかし、スポーツができないのは私達だけでなく、今は世界中の人々が同じ状況の中にいます。学校が9月までないと聞いたときは、自分の生徒達だけではなく世界中の子供達や大人達が確実に運動不足になると思いました。今私が世の中にできることは、道場で練習できない柔道家達に自宅でできる柔道の練習方法を伝え、私も一緒に実践することだと考えています。そこで私の生徒にはZOOMを使い対面で授業をし、世界中の方々に向けてはFacebookと Instagramのアプリを使い無料でオンライン授業をしています。ありがたいことですが、私のオンライン授業を楽しみにしていただいていて、一緒にトレーニングをしているというメッセージを世界中からたくさんいただきます。できることならこのままこの無料のオンライン授業を続けていきたいです。しかし道場からの収入が大幅に減った今、道場の維持や私と家族の生活を支えていくのが難しくなってきています。残念ですが、私の力だけでは継続して行くことが非常に困難です。私がオンライン授業を皆様のために継続し、私たちの道場を維持するためには、情けないですが、他の方々の協力が必要です。そこでこのクラウドファンディングを立ち上げました。私が倒れて道場がなくなると、10年間我慢してやっとここまで集まってくれた道場の生徒も、大学の生徒も、スペシャルニーズの柔道プログラムも、オンライン授業も全て終わってしまいます。是が非でも何とかこの困難を乗り越えたい、私が終わるわけにはいかないのです。　　　　　ここが正念場なのです。一生のお願いです。皆様、助けてください。佐々木伸次朗"

Our rowers compete regionally, nationally, and internationally on the U.S. Junior National Team, and have been medal winners at all levels -- holding the National Championship for five consecutive years. In addition, our alumni compete at the highest levels within the sport at college and beyond.As a club sport, New Canaan Crew/Maritime Rowing Club is self-funded and relies on annual fundraisers to purchase  necessary equipment to support the training needs of the program: high quality shells for various sized groups of rowers (ranging from single boats to ones holding up 8 rowers) oars, training ergs, weight equipment. Our equipment costs a great deal of money but makes a tremendous difference to race results in the extremely competitive arena in which NCC/MRC competes.COVID-19 has not only halted our traditional regatta season, it has forced us to cancel our traditional plant and pie fundraisers. However, we continue to persevere in the face of this challenge to not only train ,but also raise funds, so that we will be prepared for the medal podium once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. Won't you join our team as a champion supporter and cheer these kids to victory?"

Our dream was coming true and things were great until Covid-19 has thrown us flat on our back. But like true martial artists, we refuse to stay down. My name is Garry St. Leger and my humble roots began at a small dojo in Brooklyn, led by Parnel Legros (92’ Olympian, Haiti).  We were part of a community dojo in a the cafeteria of Starrett Judo.  Legros’ Program regardless of funds was exceptional.  He created a home for all individuals to learn about martial arts but also become even better people.  I was a beneficiary of his tough love leadership.  I watched countless lives changed for the better. This Influenced me to want to give back in the best way that I know how.  Over the last few months during this pandemic, we’ve done everything we can to keep the school going.  Zoom teachings, outdoor classes, you name it, we did it.  We greatly appreciate the Love and support that kept us afloat during these unprecedented times.   But the students are   ready to step back on the mat.  If you can find it in your hearts to give, we can use the funds to fill our gaps.  We have been bleeding and swimming in operational expenses.  Your kind and generous donations will Help make the transition back on the mats as smooth as possible.  It is quite costly to upgrade our hvac system and we are operating by the skin of our teeth. Like all great things, our dream is worth fighting for.  Will you join me, Garry St Leger, in the fight of our lives to get back on the mat? I know everyone is going through a hard time.

Without urgent financial help it will not survive.  Ricky Ricardo, owner and manager of the restaurant and sports bar, has been afflicted with Alzheimer’s Disease which has been progressive for the past 4 years.  His wife Tina has been doing her best to manage the sports bar but the COVID pandemic has kept Ricky’s closed in these recent months.  The cash inflow has stopped but the bills, taxes continue.  Financial help is urgently needed.  This has been the perfect storm of bad luck.  Ricky’s needs help

I am Dr. Robert Gingery.  My Vascular Surgical practice is in San Leandro and over the last 20 years Tina and Ricky have been two of my closest friends.

Ricky’s Sports Bar has been a fixture in the East Bay for nearly half a century.  It has been home base for the Oakland Raider Nation and the main gathering place to watch and share all the pro sporting events in the area and nationally.  Many of us have gathered to watch the Raiders, Golden State Warriors and the A’s over the years.  What great times.

Rick’s has hosted every kind of event: sports, clubs, local government, hospital groups, business meetings and parties.  You name it, they’ve done it.  I took a traffic school course there to avoid have my speeding ticket on my record.

I have seen Ricky and Tina create a classic place with a warm welcoming atmosphere that is unequalled elsewhere.  Ricky’s has more viewable flatscreens per square foot than any other sports bar, I have ever seen. Ricky’s Sports Bar was named one of the top 2 sports bars in the country in Sports illustrated Magazine several years ago.

How can we let it go under?

My plan is to raise enough money via this crowdfund effort to get Ricky’s through this COVID shut down period and perhaps allow them the funds to open outdoor dining until we get there.

Please help.  I know none of us wants to lose Ricky’s, one of the classic,iconic sports bars in the USA.  I know you will help.  Thanks."

At this time, we have suspended all public fundraisers for this year due to the pandemic. As you know the Spring 2020 Season was cancelled and the Club took a big financial hit.

The cost of buying this is approximately $50,000 and it will save us $10-$12,000 per year.In addition - Southampton Town United provides scholarships for the club fees for children whose families struggle financially. This year we have awarded more scholarships than ever before and simply put we are running low on funds and need to raise money to be able to continue to provide this for those families in need going forward.

Sports,PayUpForTheOwls,"Wheat Ridge, CO",15106.0,1000.0,127,193,28,"Instead of posting an update I am re-writing why this gofundme exists. I’ve learned 2 lessons this past week when this was started. 1) the lacrosse community is much more receptive to a donation page if there is social media entertainment surrounding it and 2) that same social media entertainment can get out of hand as the PLL expands beyond the lacrosse community. What started out as chirping in twitter I believe has been escalated and it is now time to distance ourselves from that. 

My favorite thing in the world is coaching, especially in areas that don’t have an abundance of college/PLL resources in their backyard. My main message while coaching is that you want to be the best lacrosse player possible, but you never want that to define who you are as a person. When I tell athletes that I hope it resonates, and I spend a significant amount of time thinking of ways to articulate it so that it resonates with them. The characteristics that define you should be much deeper than anything you can accomplish on a lacrosse field. Empathetic. Kind. Caring. Funny. Whatever it may be. What I can’t do, is talk about that while not being a role model myself. This campaign to raise money has nothing to do with social media, on field, or real life rivalries. It has to do with the lacrosse world helping out those that need it. The high risk children in Chicago largely have no idea what lacrosse is or how incredible it can be within their own community. When I visit them i refuse to be the “social media beef” guy. That’s low hanging fruit. Instead, I’d like to talk about what happens if you immerse yourself into the sport of lacrosse and how many lifelong friends/opportunities a game can give you. 

That’s the end of my rant and I’ll stop talking about myself now because ITS FOR THE KIDS"

We are ran solely by volunteers, donations from our proud sponsors, player registrations and fund raising. We are also the only league in the area to have Challenger Division.

Sports,Help Martial Way Kung-Fu,"Bronx, NY",13445.0,15000.0,204,129,292,"Hello,

The Martial Way Kung-Fu Training Center was founded in 1999 and has been servicing the Co-op City community in Bronx, NY, as well as neighboring communities, for the past 20 years.  Our programs include but are not limited to martial arts instruction for children and adults, fitness and wellness classes for adults, an after school program and a fun-filled summer camp.  All of our programs are tailored around character building as well as physical fitness and wellness.  It has been an amazing experience servicing our community and watching [literally] generations of children grow into adulthood.  As we celebrate our milestone 20 year anniversary this year, we were hopeful to continue the momentum from last year by expanding our programs as well as finishing the much needed cosmetic upgrades to our school.  

Unfortunately, this year has now become a year of uncertainty with the surge of this unprecedented pandemic that has literally touched the lives of every person in the world.  New York has been exceptionally impacted and as a result, our school is being horrifically financially impacted by the executive orders to close all non-essential businesses.  It is with great humility that I ask for financial assistance from anyone that is able to donate.  

What steps have been taken since closing in late March?
Immediately following the executive order to close, the immediate move of all kung-fu and fitness classes to an online virtual platform was made.  This task was much more cumbersome than originally thought and  took several weeks to work out the nuances of moving martial arts and fitness to an online platform.  Though we have a handful of students that are continuing their training online, overall, we have lost 85% of our memberships across the board from all of our programs.  During the school year, our after school program and kung-fu program are the two main sources of income.  With the after school program totally closed and memberships radically down, it has been difficult to meet our financial responsibilities.  

What about government aid?
The moment state and federal aid was available, I gathered all of the necessary documents to illustrate how our school was adversely impacted by Covid-19.  As you may know, the first round of federal aid was exhausted in one week due to publicly traded corporations draining millions upon millions of dollars from the fund.  Small businesses that truly need the aid had no chance.  Though there is a second round of aid that is currently available, we still have not received any money to assist us.  The state has also been very slow in their response to our request for aid.  We have applied for a number of grants and loans and are still awaiting responses.  It is important to note that there is no guarantee an approval of any of these pending applications.  

Unfortunately, there has been no communication from our landlord regarding any assistance of deferral they would be looking to provide towards rent and utilities for business in the community that have been mandated to close due to this pandemic.  At best, we will not be charged late fees.  The monthly carrying charges for our school is $4900 per month which includes all utilities, additional commercial leasing fees, and taxes.  As we go into our second month of closure, I continue to monitor this crisis daily.  Though there is no timeline as to when we will be able to open, I know for certain it will not be in the month of May.  The summer months (July & August) are usually our strongest financially due primarily to our summer camp program.  With summer camp also now in jeopardy pending social distancing and state mandates, makes it that much more critical we are able to meet our monthly obligations.  

In summation, we are all in an extremely challenging time.  My personal goal is to ensure this crisis is not the end of our school that has been so very instrumental in the part of thousands of kids' lives that have passed through our doors over the past 20 years.  This virus will pass in time.  My goal to still be able to offer the very essential services and programs for our community when it does.  All donations will be used towards our monthly rent.

Thank you in advance for your generosity and support.

We are a proud program with a rich history in not only Atlantic 10 baseball but Big 5 baseball as well. Outside of that, as we all know, baseball goes beyond the Diamond.

We represent Las Lomas Recreational Association, better known as “Las Lomas Potros Baseball Club”.This association was created in 1955 to form organized baseball in a small low-middle class neighborhood in San Juan Puerto.  Since then our program and facilities have had minor transformations with some state and private donations.Since the passage of Hurricane Maria in 2017, our facilities endure substantial damage, specifically, the lighting system. After that life-changing event, we haven’t been able to use thefacility at night or late in the afternoon. We waited patiently to see if funds were available to replace or fix the current situation. But up to this point have not received any help from any State or Federal Agency. To make matters worst, the Pandemia and lockdown have created a hardship on our overall facilities and most important the finances of the Association. Since March of 2020, when the lockdown was enforced we haven’t been able to collect any ofthe dues required to the players nor have we been able to secure any help from the private sector.  Our Club and Facilities were the most suitable for youth baseball in San Juan and many other cities of Puerto Rico. In addition, our program is the most successful Youth Baseball Program since 1955. We are in a crossroads and we need your help to keep our facilities and program afloat. We need to fix or better replace the existing lighting system and get our facilities back in shape. In addition, there are other administrative expenses that need to be taken care of, such as insurance and               materials. It is very important to mention that no one on the board of the Association has ever benefited economically form keeping this Association and Program running. Our philosophy is to develop great citizens while teaching leadership and social skills fromthe sport of baseball. Since 1955 this organization has won more than 50 championships across Puerto Rico and the United States. In addition, many MLB former and current players have been part of our program. Here is a list of some of the MLB players that have played for Las Lomas:Jorge Posada ( New York Yankees Icon )Eduardo Perez ( Played for several MLB teams and now a baseball analyst for ESPN ) Cristian Vazquez ( Boston Red Sox catcher)Jose Berrios ( Minnesota Twins Pitcher )Kike Hernadez ( LA Dodgers infielder)Joe Jimenez ( Detroit Tigers closer )Jose Morales ( Former Cubs and Rockies catcher) Andy Gonzalez ( Former White Sox infielder and Minor league manager )Tomas Nido ( NY Mets catcher )Jesus "" Motora"" Feliciano ( Former Mets player and active Angels coach )Michael Perez  (Tampa Bay catcher) Luis Atilano ( Former National's pitcher)Rey Navarrete ( Miami Marlins catcher)Alex Rios ( former Blue Jays, White Sox, and Rangers outfield)Giovanni Soto (former Cubs catcher)Plus other baseball greats like Dickie Thon, Ivan de Jesus, and Juan Nieves.Others had the chance to play College Baseball and Minor League Baseball. But more importantly, we have impacted thousands of young men and women to become better persons and contributors to society.We need your help to get our facilities ready in order to continue our mission of developing better human beings and athletes. You can also help by donating equipment for the maintenance field like tractors and machinery etc. Please contact us if you have any questions!!"

Miraculously, the current owner is looking to sell it.This is the one chance I’ll ever have to do this.For me, the story begins in 1995, the first of countless times I remember piling in the car with my siblings and parents, driving the three and a half hours from Atlanta, GA, to Nanny and Papa’s house in Petersburg, TN. This farmhouse was where we spent countless happy Thanksgivings, Christmases, and summer holidays.But for Arthur and Annie stone, the story starts 150 years before that. To the period just after the American Civil War called Reconstruction. Quick history lesson if you need one: Agriculture was the economic force of the Southern United States, and the enslavement of people descended from stolen Africans kept the economy afloat. After the enslaved became freedmen, General Sherman proposed that the land seized from former Confederates should be divided among the freedmen, as repayment for their treatment. This is commonly referred to as Forty Acres and a Mule, and it was a promise that wasn’t kept. Instead, the land was returned to the former Confederates who previously owned it. The land needed to be worked. And there was an entire population -- only recently considered citizens in their own right -- who needed work and food and security. Enter: sharecropping. Sharecropping was an exploitative model. It worked like this: a tenant would live on and work a portion of a landowner’s plantation, farm, or land. In exchange, that tenant kept a (usually small) portion of the crop come harvest time. Sharecroppers had very little agency. They didn’t own their own equipment, they were forced to accept the prices the landowners were willing to pay, and if they stuck up for themselves they risked their livelihood and family home. In the last years of her life, Nanny told me that she had taken to being pen pals with the son of the landowner she sharecropped for. He apologized for the ways he and his family had wronged my grandparents. It is no small feat that these people -- my people -- born not even 60 years after the dissolution of slavery, broke the mold of their families and somehow overcame admitted wrongdoing. That feels like another miracle. If all I ever accomplished in my life was buying back my grandparents’ farm and restoring it to something they would be proud of, that would be enough. I want to live a life where my siblings and our children can go back there for holidays. I want my mama to spend more Thanksgivings or Christmases there in her life. So I am asking you to please help me get my ancestral home back. I would appreciate anything you can contribute. And if you are not in a position to donate, all I ask is that you share the link to this campaign with everyone you can think of. Nanny and Papa spent their entire lives in the picturesque state of Tennessee; living through the roaring twenties, the great depression, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement, and so much more. Their lives make up the history of that land. It’s now on me to determine the future of it. Thank you for your help."
Wishes,Where Freedom Grows,"Whitakers, NC",101685.0,100000.0,146,1.3K,1.7K,"Update from Key:Dear ones, thank you so much for your support and willingness to dream with us! We have submitted a cash offer to the bank and they have countered at a much higher number than we anticipated - it looks like capitalism isn’t going to let this land come home without a fight. We are preparing to do battle and are raising our goal to 100k. We refuse to give up on this freedom dream and hope you will join us in our struggle to return this land to Black stewardship!

—We met our goal of $50,000! We did it! Thank you so much everybody. We are raising our goal to $70,000 in case there is a counter-offer + to support needed repairs. Thank you for keeping the love flowing!We are raising the funds to buy back a house that sits on Carlin's people's land. It was sold some 48 years ago, and today: it is for sale. We must move swiftly to obtain the necessary funds and return this land to the Black family who have stewarded it for generations.Please write the organizers for more detailed info on sending large donations via wire transfer <3---Update from Carlin on July 4 + photos of the land:The outpouring of support has been so great I am beside myself. In less than 24 hours we are almost halfway to our goal to reacquire this land. For all who have given and for all who are considering, we say thank you from the bottom of hearts for being willing to support our freedom dreams. My family and I are blown away. With your support I hope to place an offer on the property in the next 72 hours.We are looking forward to creating a safe space for our people (TGNC, Queer, BIPOC organizers, artists, teachers, healers and those who might just need to get loved on for a while) to come rest, dream, and strategize. We are trusting and believing that this is possible. We are trusting and believing that we will be able to pour even more love back into this home that has held us. Stewardship and love was my grandparents’ vision for this land and that is my goal. ---Carlin's words:There is a patch of land in North Carolina where freedom grows. The seeds were planted by my grandfather's hands over 70 years ago and have been nurtured by my family each generation since. As a child I would look out and over what he had held for us for so long and picture the unspeakable acts of terror bestowed upon the land by white men washed away by the unimaginable strength and goodness and love that my family soaked back into the earth year after year. In this time many of us find ourselves wondering what it means to find home, to fight for freedom and to hold onto it by any means necessary. This moment holds more truth and possibility and bitterness than we could have ever collectively imagined. This moment also holds within it a possibility for a return to the land. There is a house, a tired and seen many-a-thing house that sits on the land my grandfather planted those freedom seeds on. It was removed from my family's possession 48 years ago, and today - it is for sale. It is no small thing to be called to a place. It is a larger thing still to let myself hope that there is a possibility of return. As a Black Queer southern organizer, fighting for the freedom of my people is my birthright. I am seeking a reclamation of what it means to be free and am reaching out to you for support in realizing it. We have a limited amount of time to raise the money required to bring the house and the land home again. I am humbly asking for those who feel called, to give what you are able. In making this request of my community I am fighting against losing hope. Any and everything would be a blessing. In the greatest love, Carlin"

He passed away of a massive heart attack at the young age of 42. Pradeep was a wonderful son, brother, husband, and a devoted father. He had the biggest smile, a warm heart, and a caring personality. He nurtured and treasured the friendships he cultivated beginning from his childhood through school and higher education. He was a loyal friend and companion to many, never skipping an opportunity to be nostalgic about his memories with each and every one of his friends. Pradeep’s warmth extended beyond his friends and family to his professional relationships as well. Pradeep was an introspective leader, always prepared to show up in support of his team, and always willing to go the extra mile. He had a keen eye for discovering talent and was a great mentor, focused on motivating others to believe in themselves. He was a great storyteller and a keen listener who could keep a conversation engaging and fun for colleagues and friends alike. His compassion and empathy helped him communicate almost anything with the appropriate smile, always managing to come across reassuring.Pradeep was Super Dad to his kids! He always found the time to watch the Mandalorian with his son, Aarav Nayar, and do Art for Kids Hub with his daughter, Aanya Nayar. Despite wanting to travel to different places in the world, he chose to take several trips to Disney because he felt like he was able to connect with the kids the most while waiting to get on the rides.We all miss him dearly and do not know how we will ever fill the void left by his absence. This seems to be the common sentiment as different facets of his life and the positive impact he had in his short life have come to light after his death.Pradeep was passionate about teaching, coaching, and mentoring others and wanted to make a memorable contribution to the UX community. He harbored the desire to build a non-profit educational fund to support young designers in their career journey.We are establishing this fund to make some of his incomplete aspirations come true. The proceeds from the fund will be split between initiatives that support educational initiatives in the UX community and college savings for his kids, Aarav, and Aanya. We are currently reaching out to multiple organizations of Pradeep's choice to direct the funds. We will post updates soon. We miss you Pradeep!

Granddaughter to Frank, Dorothy, Jewel and Goldbourne.Sister to Adrian, Leisa, Maurice, Kevin, Kenson and Karreell.I am mother to David Justus.I am life-partner to Tony.As a child of colonization, many of my ancestors names remain unknown to me because they were displaced from Africa in the TransAtlantic slave trade. Our families broken apart; our connection to the land of our lineage severed. Yet, these ancestors are not lost to me, they live in me, breathe through me, guide me, teach me, nourish me. In turn I honor them by prioritizing and dedicating myself to the practice of midwifing these ancient bonds that make me Candace.Some of my ancestors names are unknown to me because they were likely the ones who stole, raped, enslaved and murdered my African ancestors; ripping us from our lands and families in pursuit of greed and false power. Yet these ancestors are also not lost to me, they too live in me, breathe through me, guide and teach me. In turn I honor them by alchemizing their lineage of toxic oppression and transform it into a new path for justice, healing, resistance and love. I am a servant and steward of nature; some may want to call me witch, bruja, shamaness, healer, herbalist, urban farmer or homesteader. For me, so many of these words, titles, labels don’t completely resonate like servant and steward of nature.

I am making this GoFundMe because my family is in great need of financial support. To simplify my story: my father passed away this summer and my mother was incarcerated on the  same day. I am a first-generation and low-income student, and I would like to reach out for help in paying for things I never thought I would have to worry about: life insurance, real estate property taxes, water bills, electric bills, and so on. Not only will I be juggling academic responsibilities this upcoming fall semester, but I will also be taking care of my siblings and home in North Philadelphia (Kensington). There is more for me to discover about the real world, but one pressing matter for me is money. To help alleviate this, I will be working 20 hours a week this upcoming semester, but it will not be enough to handle everything, as all of my home responsibilities were not meant to be handled by one person.Your support will enable me to continue being a steward for others, ease a hungering curiosity for science, and to take the steps necessary to give back as I transition into a working professional. In my years at Haverford College, I have created a brand for myself in running Chess Club. Despite being a mediocre player in chess, I love to teach others about it and influence my friends into it. Chess saved me from the dark places when I was growing up, and it’s always been a dream of mine to just show others how focusing on a checkerboard can do so much to help ease the mind. More than just a game, I also use chess as a catalyst to help teach youth in the neighboring Ardmore community at Haverford. This semester, I will virtually continue to run Chess Club with my team, and I will do so to help provide a sanctuary for others, as it’s always been for me. For my mission of Chess Club, it’s always been about “others” and I will continue this more than ever.Your generosity will allow me to continue my pursuit of a college degree and become the first in my family to graduate from college. I am grateful for your consideration. Thank you for reading,Jr"
Wishes,Help Elizabeth Shaffer Get An Accessible Van,"Akron, OH",33395.0,25000.0,130,231,527,"Hello to our community,As many of you know, my mom's Multiple Sclerosis has progressed in the past 6 years. She is now using a power wheelchair, utilizing the mobility she has in her left, non-dominant hand to operate the joystick. Because of the fact that my mom spent the years before her symptoms raising four kids and going back to school for Social Work (graduating a year before her symptoms became debilitating),  she did not earn enough  work credits and therefore does not qualify for disability assistance. She is still ten years away from being eligible for Medicare. This means that full-time home care, assistive technology, and home modifications have been and will continue to be out of pocket expenses for my family.  Currently, we have no way to transport my mom outside of the house in her power chair due to its weight. Our hope is to get my mom an accessible van so that she can participate in and enjoy the things she used to do, such as visiting friends and family, going to church, going up to Lake Michigan, volunteering at hospice, riffing through produce at the grocery store, and going on walks through the MetroParks.  The total cost of a used, accessible van is between 40-45k. This includes the price of the van and around 20-25k in added conversions cost to make it handicap accessible. We are hoping to offset the conversion part of this purchase through the contributions we might raise. This is why we have chosen 25k as our target amount. We plan on closing this fundraiser at the end of August. To give clarity on our situation, my family is focusing their financial resources on modifying our house to include a first floor accessible bedroom and bathroom, so that my mom can stay at home. With this, in addition to upcoming care expenses and other adaptations, we are experiencing financial strain and would like to minimize any additional borrowing that we can. It is difficult to ask for help. I know that many of us are under financial strain due to COVID-19, and there are so many organizations to donate to that are fighting for racial and economic justice in our current moment. It is easy to feel like there is not enough, but we believe that orienting ourselves toward abundance, community, and generosity brings about the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth for all of us. If you cannot help financially, there are so many other ways to bless my mom during this time! Spiritual nourishment through phone calls, visits, mail, and prayer all bring joy to my mom. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We love you and are already so thankful to be a part of a caring community!!"

It is their calluses I can feel pushing through the tender surface of each aching palm; a young corn stalk fighting to witness the waning light. As the evening sun settles in sheets of solid grey I can hear the nay saying whisper “honey do not work the soil—this is not your land” and I do not take heed. The coming night forces elongated shadows into the city scape and the silhouettes of my tomato plants appear minacious, sinister, forboding and I do not mind. Sealed against a Los Angeles night sky I kick my worn boots against the compost bin door, loosening the compacted soil and frightening the flighty pigeons who come to the garden for corn and camaraderie. “Our family farmed until we didn’t have to anymore. And then we were free to live “ my great uncle once told me, gathered around a Thanksgiving table. “why would you want to go back to that?” he questioned. Helping himself to another ear of corn.If I pull up the weeds ,will I pull away the curtains of the past? Turning the soil and turning back the hands of time; each shovel full of dirt unearthing the still warm, still beating heart of a black woman.My grandmothers mother saying “you don't have to do this anymore.” What if I plant a seed? Will it grow not from the surface but from somewhere else, deep within the earth where our ancestors, unappeased, still dwell?I once met a young man of color at an earth skills gathering. We found solace in each others company and had no trouble falling into the deep conversations that I usually reserve for childhood friends. He told me he owned a farm thirty minutes from the rocky soils where I grew up. His farm is a cattle and produce farm and he told me that he regularly took in young black kids as apprentices. I expected him to speak of them with high regard, excitement for a future of farming people of color, envisioning a revolution in which our children take back the land. Instead, he disparaged them. He told me that they were “mostly useless” and that they were not concerned with how things grow or why we should want them to. He did not respect them. He did not see them as they are; young shoots of bamboo with delicate leaves and malleable stalks waiting for the moment that they might shoot toward the sky in lustered resilience. He failed to buoy their creativity and, in return, they did not flourish. When I was 20 I was a back-to the- lander. Folks would often ask me why I want to live without running water, to cook on a wood stove, and baptize myself in the occasional flowing stream in lieu of a hot shower? The answer then and now has always been simple: Because there are two wars being fought within the Black community—one is a war on health wherein we cannot access the foods that will nourish our being. The other is a war on our education wherein we cannot find the mentors to lend a hand of inclusivity. Many of the children of color that I work with feel the need to elevate their status. To show the world they are not ‘worthless’ despite what others have been lead to believe. Unfortunately, symbols of status and farming seem to be mutually exclusive. Living a life of resourcefulness wherein you do not depend on the capitalist regime is not favored. Farming becomes less and less important. Their fields lie fallow.The lessons that I have learned from the nights that I spend with my great, great grandmother, when she whispers to me through the white pines and tulip poplars bathed in the luminescence of a blood moon are lessons of resilience. Her voice comes to me like a waking dream, each word sturdy like a promise deep within my being where love takes root and understanding blooms. There is a place within the soul that fears that history will fold in on itself like the old accordion style road maps, each route colliding and melding into one confused loop. We are afraid that in climbing the ladder we might fall and land further down than we began. I want to silence this fear. I want to hold my grandmothers mothers hand, and together walking through my gardens I will  tell her, “ We made this. This land is ours”"

Wishes,Tatte Family for Black Lives Matter,"Boston, MA",28743.0,1000.0,173,123,76,"We are Tatte employees who are angered and frustrated by the racial injustices in the United States as a direct result of police brutality and institutionalized racism against the Black community since the inception of this nation. We see the atrocities committed at the hands of the police and we understand that the country we live in today was built on the oppression of Black Americans. We have seen Tatte’s supposed stance on Instagram as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement but unfortunately, we have yet to see tangible actions made by the corporation. During our time at Tatte, we have all learned the story of its founding and internalized the values the company defines itself by. ""Our mission,"" you claim, ""is to inspire, care for and touch every person, neighborhood, and city with our experience through our food, our passion, and our culture."" We believe that it is impossible to care for our community—within Boston and beyond—without acknowledging the horrors Black Americans have faced within the United States and making a clear commitment to using your privilege and financial resources to support organizations that work for justice. Tatte has looked to the Black community to fill available positions, whether it be in front of house, back of house, or in managerial positions. We believe that this hospitality should be extended outside of just clock-in and clock-out hours, especially when the lives of our Black employees are being threatened. It is Tatte’s duty to protect its Black employees who work every day to uphold the Tatte Mission Statement.Similar businesses, such as Blue Bottle, Pret a Manger, Pavement Coffeehouse, etc. have donated and matched their employees’ donations towards BLM funds. In response to this, we are hereby petitioning Tatte to match its employee donations dollar for dollar. We have organized a GoFundMe page — linked below — to compile all current donations. The donations will be evenly distributed to the American Civil Liberties Union, BLM of Boston, and the Boston Mutual Aid Fund. As Tatte employees, we are hungry for change in our communities, and we are asking our employer to support us in this endeavor. With that being said, we will be asking Tatte to match whatever we raise.We have (1) employee with the GoFundMe login who's sole job is distributing the funds. Once the money is withdrawn, it will be donated to the three organizations --money will be split equally three ways. and screenshots will immediately be posted to ensure there is a level of transparency. Two of the three organizations have donation portals on their sites so money will be sent that way. The last org ( the boston mutual aid fund) is smaller and for that reason that money will be sent to them via cashapp."

My youngest sister and I are both affected by a disease called SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) a form of Muscular Dystrophy.  The disease is characterized by not allowing my muscles to strengthen as I grow.  I have limited mobility and have used a power wheelchair since the age of 4.  I’m now 18 years old, and a Senior at Carl Sandburg High School.  I am very active in school participating in Robotics, Marching Band,  and Bass Fishing.  Academically my coursework includes all honors and AP classes while maintaining a 4.2 GPA.  I am a member of Mu Alpha Theta, National Honor Society, and Tri-M (Music Honors Society).  My most recent accomplishment was receiving the Heart of the Arts Award.  This is a National Award representing the Midwest United States.  The award is given to an individual who rises above their limitations to excel in both school and in the community.  In order to receive this award a couple of things that were considered are earning 300+ community service hours, as well as participating on the field as a percussionist in Marching Band despite being in a wheelchair.  I also took 2nd Place in the IHSA Bass Fishing Finals at Carlyle Lake, and 2nd Place at the FIRST Midwest Regional Competition for Robotics.My lifelong dream is to become a mechanical engineer trying to design products for people like myself to allow them better mobility and a more fulfilling life.  My plans are to follow the University of Illinois Engineering tract through Moraine Valley,  eventually transferring to the U of I campus. The purpose of this GoFundMe is to provide funding for a wheelchair accessible vehicle complete with hand controls so I can transport myself to and from college so I can secure my dream.  This vehicle is quite costly.  A package like  this new can cost upward of $70,000.  My plan is to fund a vehicle like this in good used condition for a lesser amount.I truly appreciate any support in helping me make my dream come true."

Wishes,Empowering Cuts,"Philadelphia, PA",49700.0,50000.0,89,1.4K,824,"Donate to bring hope one haircut at a time! You know the great feeling you have whenever you walk out of a hair salon or barbershop with a fresh haircut? You feel refreshed and alive! There is just something about a great haircut that puts a bounce back in your step! Unfortunately, the cost of a haircut is often not within reach as some must first prioritize where their next meal is coming from or where they will be sleeping that night. My name is Joshua Santiago and I am a barber based out of Philadelphia. I am the founder of Empowering Cuts, a non-profit organization that travels the country providing free haircuts to the homeless, military veterans, children, and families who are experiencing financial hardships. I know all too well what it is like to not be able to afford something as simple as a haircut. When I was a child, my father would cut my hair and mess it up every time because we didn’t have the money to afford the luxury of going to a barbershop. As an adult, I enrolled in barber school where my life and outlook changed forever. My barber instructor would take the entire class to shelters, offering free haircuts. This is how we learned how to cut hair professionally. Being able to bless someone meant more to me than to actually receive money for it. Over the last 4 years, Empowering Cuts has worked with over 50 organizations in over 20 different cities from coast-to-coast. We have been featured in roughly 10 different written and visual news outlets. Last but certainly not least, we have been responsible for grooming over 7,500 men, women and children all over the country, FREE OF CHARGE. We don’t just cut hair. We wash it, style it, and have even done nails and makeup for women, as well, all in the hopes of brightening someone’s day! Empowering Cuts also understands while some people may not be experiencing homelessness, they simply need some hope and light in their life. We have actively sought after these individuals and surprised them with thousands of dollars in donations contributed through the Empowering Cuts’ Social Media community on Instagram and Facebook. The help we have been able to give these individuals has ranged from money to food, drinks, cleaning supplies, hygiene supplies and full grooming services all thanks to the generous donations of people just like you! We Want To Do MORE and you can HELP!! I have purchased a 32’ camper RV to be able to use it as a mobile location for Empowering Cuts! We will use this camper to travel the country frequently and provide hope to the communities we touch. Through your generous donations, the camper will be fitted with: ·        Flooring·        Proper lighting·        3 barber chairs·        Barber stations·        A sanitary bathroom·        Shampoo bowl station·        Electrical and plumbing·        A Lounge Area·        Auto Repairs/Mechanic·        Auto body painting This will allow me to be more mobile and help even more individuals on the road doing my life’s work while offering FREE barber services to even more people in need! Your help in transforming this RV into the mobile headquarters of Empowering Cuts will allow you to see that you are not only investing in me, Joshua Santiago, but you are investing in your fellow brothers and sisters all across the country. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support! Additionally, I welcome you to join me on my journey as I highlight the lives and experiences of our homeless men and women across the country which will be shared on our social media. Please take the time to share my campaign with your family, friends, and loved ones.

Wishes,Patrice is Finally Free! Help Her Start A New Life,"New York, NY",27364.0,25000.0,46,727,618,"After serving almost 22 years in prison, a new law in New York State called the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act (DVSJA) allowed a Judge to reconsider the 25 years to life prison sentence of my aunt Patrice. The presiding Judge carefully considered the effects of the sexual abuse Patrice endured starting when she was just 15 years old.  In 1998, when she was tried and convicted,  no one believed that a pastor would abuse a young girl.  Her trial and conviction took place when she was 16 years old in 1998. She just came home a few weeks ago, at the age of 38. Patrice is one of the first people released under the DVSJA. In her decision resentencing Patrice Smith under the new law, the Judge wrote: “The 'full picture' here is one of a 16 year old girl who had been raped, abused and coerced by a man 55 years her senior, who had exploited and coerced her through escalating offers of money and gifts for sex and by threatening to expose the relationship to her father. The repeated abuse defendant endured cannot be compartmentalized or separated from her actions on the night of the crime. They are inextricably interlinked...What we have learned in the two decades since the defendant's sentencing is that domestic violence should be viewed by our criminal justice system in a manner that recognizes not only their status as offenders but their status as survivors.”It is under this umbrella that I am asking the community to help support  Patrice's reentry into society. As I am only twenty years old, my aunt has been incarcerated for my entire life. I along with my three sisters grew up visiting her in prison, spending the nights through the facility’s Family Reunion Program. She never once hinted at a traumatic past. She instead encouraged us, played with us, kept our secrets and most of all,  loved us. It was not until I was an adult that I learned her real story, and even now when I speak to her I am amazed at how encouraging and optimistic she is and I am so proud of her. Our family is rejoicing together now that she is home with us. While incarcerated Patrice earned her Associate’s and Bachelor’s degrees. She is now hoping to join a Master’s program. In addition she plans to help educate the public about the new DVSJA law,  with hopes of freeing more criminalized survivors, and ultimately  getting similar laws passed in more states.My aunt Patrice can never get back the years she lost in prison, but with your help she may be able to prevent another young girl from enduring this abuse or being silenced by it. Please give to help Patrice start a new life in freedom and community building. Patrice's case in the news:Judge grants Patrice Smith freedom Judge has mercy on Buffalo woman Photo copyright Sara Bennett 2020"

Making this is not only the hardest few paragraphs that I’ve ever had to write, but it’s also one of those things that I never thought I would be doing, especially at 25 years old.
Taylor Symone Hill, aka “Monks”, a nickname given by my mom, was born February 4, 2001. She was a daughter, cousin, niece, friend, an older sister of 2, and my younger sister. From the day she was born she made a special impact in everyone’s life, effortlessly lighting up the rooms she walked in, with just a smile. Taylor’s love and energy is missed everyday, not a minute has gone by where we haven’t all wished for just one last “one last” with her. One last Laugh. One last Kiss. One last Hug. One last Smile. 
Taylor was placed on this Earth with the purpose of always giving back and wanting more for everyone. She was attending Rutgers, with aspirations of becoming an RN. As her big brother, I had the responsibility of protecting my sister making sure she got everything she wished for, and with this GoFundMe, I need everyone’s help in doing just that. 

With the proceeds being donated towards Monks’Memorial we plan to create a foundation in Taylor’s name with the purpose of keeping Taylor’s memory and the love she had for people alive by awarding the next generation of rising stars, scholarship money in her name."

He was known for both his industry knowledge and ability to innovate. For decades Mitch delivered superior results, led global teams, developed incredible business relationships.  Mitch helped build businesses from the ground up and then led by example every day since.  He was a world-class Financial Services expert and leader in every sense. While Mitch’s professional accomplishments are immense and inspiring, he was an even better person, a loyal and loving friend, an incredible father, a sports enthusiast, and someone who would always go out of his way to lend a helping hand.  Mitch was someone you could turn to for help during a tough day, even if that just meant getting a few good laughs in.  His boys were his pride and joy; Brandon, 20 is about to enter his junior year at Syracuse University while Justin, 16 is attending High School with college right around the corner. The boys’ education was very important to Mitch and he saw it as his top priority.  Mitch has touched the lives of so many through his personal and professional interactions and no surprise many of you have reached out to see how you could help and recognize and remember Mitch. There was no bigger priority for Mitch and his wife than to provide every opportunity for their sons, Brandon and Justin. It is with this purpose that we are starting this fundraising campaign to help Brandon and Justin complete their education as a legacy to Mitch.   This message and any attachments are intended only for the use of the addressee and may contain information that is privileged and confidential.

Wishes,Emily's Trust Blitz Fundraiser for Oxford,"Redding, CA",25718.0,25000.0,110,210,410,"A dream of mine has come true:  I have been accepted to study theology at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford University and take part in their new Theologos program! Theologos is an experimental community centering a diverse selection of believing Oxford students in daily prayer and worship.  The small cohort will study scripture, theology, apologetics and christian ministry.  We will be unpacking the big questions of our generation in Oxford’s ancient halls.  For far too long the realm of the spirit has gone unsung in the academy, and Theologos is seeking to remedy this.Most notably, in residence is the authoritative theologian NT Wright; a foremost authority on the Apostle Paul and a personal hero of mine.  His making himself available by meeting with Theologos weekly is a massive privilege.  If he is unknown to you, imagine discussing your reading over lunch with a modern day CS Lewis.  He’s a very big deal! Wycliffe Hall has assembled a diverse group for the program.  I personally have spent the last 7 years at Bethel where I completed three years of the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry and was discipled for 4 years in the realm of spiritual intelligence. I have focused on developing my gift of discerning of spirits and honing a strong awareness of atmospheres, relational dynamics and Heaven’s blueprints over humans and cities.  I am honored to now take that experience into the scholastic halls of the academy!Where this will lead, I don’t know —but I am no stranger to Oxford.  Heaven likes this place.  I worked for St Aldates, the Anglican church in the heart of Oxford from 2012 -2013, and have returned often since to build relationships with residents and minister to the city.  In its streets I feel the massive creative potential and powerful authority the inhabitants are tapping into.  Simon Ponsonby, a pastor of theology at St Aldates, explained to me that it was actually the plan of Adolf Hitler to rule the Third Reich from Oxford.  Remarkably, the city, while beautiful and ancient, is not the prettiest of Europe, nor the most strategically situated.  Hitler’s plans only make sense to those who look in the spirit.  This city, known for its intellectuals, is a seat of power.  World leaders spend formative years in Oxford and many influential hearts and minds pass through it.  It is a sobering privilege to worship amongst them, learn with them, and to pray for them.  It is humbling and exciting to take part in a story so much bigger than me!My flight is booked.  My room secured.  I even have all of my books for the course! BUT like every great story a test has presented itself, my hurtle to overcome:  I was denied the loan to cover my tuition. I was genuinely surprised.  I had a little cry, indulged a brief panic, and then asked a host of friends what the Lord was saying. I didn't tell them what the problem was, just asked for the solution.Without even knowing the situation, the overwhelming response to their prayers was that I was to go.  To jump, to buckle up, to launch, to trust and watch Him make it happen.  And so that's where you find me: following Jesus into the unknown. Here's the situation: I have less than a week to raise $25,000 to apply for my visa. The deadline is this Friday, August 14.I know.  This is literally impossible. But also a wonderful wall worth walking through.  I think the Lord is assembling a puzzle, one that involves many players.  I believe the launching of the Theologos program is a part of the interlocking jigsaw God is assembling in the earth to bring spiritual intelligence into the conversation.  I don’t profess to know the full picture, but I know that I too want to be a puzzle piece.  I want to sit across from the brightest minds in Oxford’s darkest halls and speak not only from the mind or the heart, but spirit to spirit.  I want to be on the streets of ”The City of Dreaming Spires” as other pieces awaken.  Will you invest in me? Emily"

Molly has a unique way of connecting with her Instagram followers, whether it’s with her hilarious videos of her dogs or her honesty, transparent and graceful way in which she discusses topics that usually make people uncomfortable or sad. If all of that has not drawn people to her, it’s her kindness that does. Undeterred by the negative attitude towards the police and with what little free time she has she, Molly encourages people to be kind to one of other and leads in this by example. Molly organizes K9 teams to go to surprise ill children at their homes with K9 parades. She fundraises and arranges for equipment for other K9’s in her department. Molly loves to give back to her community through random acts of kindness such as the raising the funds to give a large tip to a waitress, sending teachers Lando swag to thank them for the job they do etc.  Molly has an incredible upbeat and happy disposition despite everything she has had to deal with.
 
Molly is aware that we want to do this for her and with her blessing we have organized this Go Fund me. Molly would never ask for anything from anyone for herself, which is why this Go Fund me for her is so special to many of us. Molly has been very honest about her previous struggles with anorexia in the past but that was a long time ago and has also documented her struggles with infertility in hopes of helping others who are struggling like her. Molly’s dream is to become a mother and we want to help ease the financial burden that comes with this kind of treatment. She has endured endless tests, procedures, and treatments in her efforts to become pregnant. Molly has become pregnant only to have the  pregnancy end in heartbreak. After exhausting all options Molly and big old cop husband need a more invasive and expensive treatment called IVF. We want Molly to concentrate her efforts on getting her body and mind ready for pregnancy and not to worry about the monetary aspect. Molly has given unselfishly of herself to others and now we have the ability to give unselfishly back to her.
 
We appreciate any and all donations. Please watch for patches, stickers, coins etc. that you will be able to purchase in support of Molly. We will also be having raffles with amazing prizes. Special thank you to the small businesses that have come forward with donations and special pricing for this fundraiser. We are humbled by everyone who has reached out to help. It shows how much Molly means to the K9 and police community.
 
Many thanks for your support. Please donate and share    #teambabygroce"

Friends, relatives, comrades and other loved ones. I’m deciding to create this fundraiser on this New Moon during Black August to set intentions for things I wish for myself.Without giving a long grocery list of things I’ve done for the many communities I’m part of let me just say hello, my name is edxi.  I’m a community organizer, writer and artist, always  doing my best, attempting to be the best relative and future ancestor I can be for my Black, Filipinx and Nitsítaapi blood fam and non huMAN relatives.  Trans womn & femmes of color, particularly Black trans womn deserve to ask for the things they wish to receive in the world like anyone else, beyond gender confirming surgeries, support after we’re bashed or for funeral costs of friends n loved ones.  Despite the work we do or visibility we have. So I’m extending my ask to anyone and everyone I know or don’t know in helping me in achieving my dangerous dreams of becoming the self that I wish to see in this world.I’m trying to not be reluctant in the asks I make of others or my community for fear of judgements, And I’m asking anyway.  The funds I’m asking for will cover a huge portion of  my surgeries, mental health and after care.  Much love to many others who’ve inspired me and encouraged me to make these asks. May we all find freedom.

My wife is going through a very difficult immigration process (click on above links to read the details) though she has lived in the U.S. since she was an infant. She was raised as an American and believed herself to be a citizen until she was 22 years old. She's a wonderful woman. Any country would be happy to have people like her. Though America doesn't recognize her right now, I believe it someday will. I believe my wife will get to call America ""home"" again without reservation. We have been working diligently for 5 years now, doing everything within our power to obtain legal status for my wife. It's been a long and difficult journey with a series of small heartbreaks along the way. I want my wife to live in this country, her country, without fear of being detained and/or deported to a country she knows nothing about. Last year, I hired a great immigration lawyer. With great legal help comes great financial responsibilities. I'm afraid that with the direction this case is taking, we may be in over our heads financially. If we do go to federal court (and it looks like we will), it will likely cost a lot of money in legal fees. I was quoted $25k to 40k in legal fees by a different attorney last year in order to take my wife's case to court - hence the large goal amount on this fundraiser.I ask you to partner with us in this whether it's financially, prayerfully, or writing letters to your Congressional Representatives in support of private bills S. 3490 - A bill for the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the Senate) and H.R. 7807 - For the relief of Rebecca Trimble (in the House). These must be approved in both parts of Congress and then be signed by the President to become a private law granting Becky permanent residency.If you would like a template support letter, I have two examples that may be helpful. If enough Senators and Representatives start hearing about Rebecca's case, it can make a huge difference. Make a comment if you would like the example letters and I  can send them via email.I came across this Bible passage awhile back and it struck a chord in my heart because of our situation. It's provided a lot of encouragement to me during difficult times...""Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord , and he will give you your heart’s desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord . Trust him, and he will help you. He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn, and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.""Psalms 37:3‭-‬6 NLTWith gratitude and clinging to His promises,John"

I’m a second year college student on a two year break (currently) and I’ve been working to save funds for my transition and my education.

However, since 2018 I’ve worked in customer service averaging around 26 hours weekly and only getting paid $9.75 hourly. It’s a stable position and I’m grateful for it because a lot of people don’t have jobs right now, but it’s becoming too much to bear. 

I live with my grandparents, and while I do love them, I don’t feel like they understand me or my struggles as the person I am. I want to move on, I want to transition and I want to be great. I want to be loved, but most importantly,
I want to be happy. 
If you could spare even a dollar for my cause it would make my entire life so much better. Thank you in advance.

Wishes,FASHION TRANSFORMATION FUND,"New York, NY",21263.0,50000.0,74,588,8,"Dear Reader, Hello I’m Fashion. I’m a trans woman living in NYC. I’m having a series of upcoming gender affirming surgeries, and I’m looking for assistance with the associated costs when I am unable to use my body to work. I’m a survival sex worker who actually isn’t so psychologically apt for that kind of work (for a myriad of reasons.) & I have no safety net or familial support. I have been transitioning for 9 years on my own which often has averted me from accessing resources and opportunities to better my life. For example, I was unable to attend college for years because I was a “dependent” student who wasn’t supported by my parents as a person. The only way as a teenager I could access health insurance in order to have  hormones was if I remained in the books of literal poverty. If I made over a certain amount of money I would disqualify from the insurance. In retrospect hormones obviously were a necessity that improved my mental health, my capability doing sex work, and my ability to make more money. I had “normal jobs” where I experienced rampant transphobic discrimination, sexual harassment, racism, and many more things that damaged my self worth. I was scarred from that kind of work. There was no guidance, no healthy coping mechanisms, and no clear framework for how I was to navigate survival that I understood or could access as a naive, transient, transgender youth.Recently, I have had a string of traumatic experiences that have pushed me to seek out these surgeries to ensure my safety/ mental health/ survival. I want to further align my body with my self-idealized gender presentation and mitigate more of my deeply inhibiting gender dysphoria. Being trans is extremely expensive and often inaccessible. This is why I’m asking for help. I know that by prioritizing my own needs I will be able to continue to help uplift and elevate many other people around me. I am concerned with building community, supporting other people like me with less privilege, access, and mobility. I want to liberate others from the confines of their minds and the social constructs that hold us hostage to systems of constraint and oppression. I want to continue to honor the legacy of those who have paved the way for girls like me, and continue to pave the way for those to come. However, I will admit it is actually very difficult to do so when I sometimes am unable to help myself! I chose the latest iteration of my name -Fashion- not to commemorate the materiality of clothing, or the legacy of exclusivity/ exclusion of a highly decadent and capitalistic world, but because the verb/ active form of Fashion means “to style”. Although life is difficult and trying, I hope to style a better future for myself and continue to contribute to the fashioning of our global consciousness.Thank you so much for reading and if you decide to help me in any form- monetarily, socially, spiritually, energetically. I appreciate sincerity periodXXMuch love,Fashion"

A 24 hour, 7 day a week operation he worked endless hours to provide for his family and sacrificed a lot to maintain the quality service and food that the neighborhood has grown to love throughout the years. Greatness is a quality that Chris strived for and it was reflective in his establishment as well as his incredible loyal employees. Although Kellogg’s diner was already a success from its predecessor Chris propelled it that much greater. With his warm personality and incredibly delicious food and a lot of hard work and determination Kellogg’s diner was built out of sheer love with its main focus in providing the very best service and quality food. In 2018 life changed forever for Irene and her beautiful boys losing her soulmate. The loss of Chris has been tremendous and carrying on was very difficult. Irene was left as head of household now having to take over the business and navigate life without her beloved Chris by her side, to navigate a business she had no knowledge of but tried her very best because her motivating factor were her boys. She eventually learned the business and was phenomenal at what she did. Then COVID 19 struck and yet another blow. The limitation placed on her business made it tough to make ends meet and today she is left in a difficult position wondering if at all she can regain the momentum the business once had. A loving, selfless mom that would give her shirt off her back to help someone out is now in need of help. She is on the verge of losing her business, her livelihood. I am asking all of you at this time to please donate what you can to keep my amazing friend and her beautiful boys afloat until this all gets figured out. No donation is too small. I thank you all in advance for your generosity."

I’m trying to help raise money for Hayley Marie Wilson ❤️ Hayley was born with a condition called Amniotic band syndrome! 3 years ago Hayley fell in love with my grandson and I instantly fell in Love myself! She was welcomed with open heart and arms. Hayley is almost 21 and has lived her life with 1 hand. Though this has never stopped her. She played basketball in school, plays a guitar, and I even taught her to crochet! Hayley is now a caregiver/nurses aide. Always helping others. I know she has mixed emotions. She has learned and managed with 1 hand her whole life. Yet she’s excited at the thought of what she could do with 2 hands. Then sad due to the cost. Hayley was recently fitted for a Hero Arm at the Hanger Clinic. They said that she’s a great candidate because of the strength in her arm. Times are hard right now and it is no different for her.

Their son will be born early January, and we want to make sure that he and his mama will have everything they could possibly need, as she navigates through this devastating tribulation.

Years ago, my grandparents were in some financial trouble and were desperate to keep their home. At the time, I wasn’t living in the city so i could not be there to help. The other members of my family were not and are still not in a position to help out financially so my grandparents were talked into a reverse mortgage by a shady company that is no longer active. Fast forward some years, I’m back in the city and I’m now taking care of my grandparents. Got their bills paid, a new roof (was leaking for at least 20 years) new furnace, new water heater and household appliances for ease of living. In  2018 my grandfather passed away from lung disease, I told him I would take care of the family and that he could rest easy. I had kept that promise so far. It is now 2020 and my grandmother is now in hospice care (she too has lung disease as well as kidney disease) and I've ran out of time to save up the necessary funds to secure the home back from a new reverse mortgage company. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem, but the covid crisis and some other unforeseen circumstances have shut down a lot of my business plans. Those who know me know that I would rather live in a shack or go broke before I asked for help, but this situation affects more than me. That is why I created this donation page..To help pay for the reverse mortgage and save the family home. 

I would ask that people don’t go over 20 dollars per donation. Times are rough for everyone and I already don’t like the thought of putting my family needs over others. 

Thank you in advance for all your support."

That’s my diagnosis and that’s what I’m fighting. As I try to sit here and type this out it’s really hard to find the words I want to say while fighting back the tears. I’m frustrated and angry because at 22 I should be thinking of my future husband and the babies I’m supposed to hold in my arms and call my own, and I don’t get that. I’m supposed to finish nursing school and get a degree and help others going through what I’m going through, and I don’t get that. I’m supposed to be hanging out with my friends and partying but instead I get a hospital bed a a body that’s tired and fighting with everything it has.And as much as I can sit here and be mad and upset and confused, I don’t want that, because the life I have lived and am still living is so amazing and filled with so many blessings that I am so thankful for. I’m at peace with death because I believe in a God that is SO MUCH greater than a diagnosis and ultimately has the final say in this. This fight isn’t over and I will give it all I have. But I want everyone to know that Heaven is real and when my time does come it’ll be a beautiful thing and I’m not scared of that. 

I just want everyone to know how much I love God and how this world, not just for me, is temporary and we have a wonderful forever home waiting for us.I’m making this go fund me page to help me check off some things on the bucket list and I know you guys want to help in any way you can so hopefully this gives you a way to do that, but not feel obligated.

My family and I appreciate all the help and words of encouragement. Prayers are so powerful and I believe this is going to be a GOOD fight. We got this, and God’s got me❤️"

Wishes,Queer Creative & Spiritual Retreat Space!,"Brooklyn, NY",17459.0,100000.0,105,234,70,"I'm Myles E. Johnson, a 29-year-old Black queer artist and spiritual adviser living in Brooklyn, NY. I'm the author of LGBTQIA+ children's book, LARGE FEARS and my other work has been featured in Essence, New York Times, and The Advocate. I've had the pleasure to teach at  The New School and speak at places like the MoCADA Museum and Schomburg Center.My life's work has been about empowering and offering relief, both sociopolitical and spiritual, to the LGBTQIA+ community, especially those living at the intersection of race and class through my art. My reason for starting this crowdfunding effort is an attempt to purchase and renovate this beautiful pink home located in New Berlin, New York so it can serve as an artist and spiritual retreat space for the Black LGBTQIA+ community. As the world turns, it has become obvious that there must be space for the Black LGBTQIA+ community to be able to restore, create, recenter, and reconnect. I believe this home could be a healing space in a time where so many wounds are being produced. (1) All money would go to purchasing the home and other taxes/fees, and all other money would go into the renovation of the home since it needs a lot of work. (2) All further money would go into paying the members of our community to create programs and workshops to be held there.(3)  And if for some reason, there is still a surplus of money, it would go into locating another space in the South to serve the same purpose. (4) And finally, if this space is no longer available by the conclusion of the crowdfunding, it would go into finding another space to serve the same purpose in the Northeast. I truly believe spaces that center and heal Black LGBTQIA+ people are necessary and it will serve everyone if we intentionally nurture the genius and beauty that in return nurtures the world, especially in times of crisis and despair like these."

Healing, wellness, and spiritual growth is not something many WOC have access to or the belief we have a right to experience. We have been taught and conditioned to hold and carry so much while taking care of others, in addition to inheriting generational trauma. In honor of Juneteenth, I’m personally raising funds to provide as many WOC with $500 scholarships to attend a healing Woman Within Weekend in the upcoming year. Scholarships will be distributed among our US regions.Woman Within  is a community near and dear to my heart and has been a catalyst in my own healing journey. While I facilitate and participate in many organizations, retreats and gatherings that center around wellness and education for women, this intensive is unique. Woman Within International is the largest non-profit organization offering programs and workshops for women with a priority for emotional safety. There are opportunities for self discovery, reclamation, deep healing and empowerment. My hope is for more individuals to experience support and restoration with an allowance of healing for their own personal growth.

Wishes,All-Terrain Wheelchair for Benjamin Wimett,"Brandon, VT",19300.0,17000.0,200,279,2.5K,"I am 35 years old and was born with cerebral palsy. I'm a native Vermonter and have lived here my entire life. I love the outdoors, hunting, fishing and photography. I do all these things with a traditional electric wheelchair but my wheelchair is not designed for Vermont's rugged terrain and severely limits where I can access to do the activities I live by myself with the help ofmy family and friends. Obtaining a all-terrain or track wheelchair would truly eliminate the biggest barrier preventing me from accessing all of wonderful Vermont.As I continue to get older so to my family and friends and it's harder and harder to continue to do what I use to because I simply just can't access the places I could when I was younger and my body was physically a lot healthier. I haven't been able to fish for about five years at all, with the off-road wheelchair I would like to purchase I would be able to submerge myself in up to a foot of water and probably allow myself to trout fish in some places for the first time in my life.I have visions of doing winter photography and close-up wildlife shots on mountainsides and streams and bogs at the camp in the Adirondacks that my dad and brothers and family belong to previously I've only been able to enjoy through stories of their successes. I will be able to access Vermont year-round and should be able to traverse up to a foot plus of snow or more if it's packed down. I would be able to visit the oceans in New Hampshire and Maine and drive along beaches for the first time since I was a small child.Myself or my family has never asked for help financially with anything and I understand that during this time it may seem like a strange request for help but as I alluded to above as I continue to age as well as my family because of the train of Vermont it continues to get harder and harder for me to enjoy the state that I love so much independently and easily. My body has also started to break down physically and I can't just be thrown over someone's shoulder anymore to get where I need to be like we have done in the past.I realize I need to raise a lot of money $17,000 is a slightly liberal estimate and I may be able to secure something for around 15,000 however I also need several positioning upgrades and I may need to purchase a small utility trailer to tow it from place to place as it will not fit in any type of wheelchair van due to its with.Below is a picture of the device itself and you can find out more information about it by going  here To view more of my photography if you're on Facebook you can visit here I've also posted one of my favorite recent photos below. You can also request to add me personally on Facebook by searching for Benjamin John Wimett.

Wishes,Martha's Daughter,"Amherst, MA",21435.0,300000.0,110,318,868,"Greetings,My name is Nyanyika Banda. I am a chef, writer and entrepreneur. Today I am inviting you to join me in investing in an exciting and important business venture.  The foundation of this project  began 70 years ago, when my great grandmother, Marie Elliott,  purchased a home and surrounding property on the Upper Cape in Massachusetts, and ran it as a lodging home and bed and breakfast called Wagon Wheel. At the time, my family were the only Blacks to own land in the area. To this day, they still are. For the past 20 years I have worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry. My first job was at a small family owned restaurant when I was 15 years old, where I prepped vegetables and cleaned tables. I fell into curiosity with recipes and then I fell in love with cooking.  For the last two decades I have traveled the world working as a chef and entrepreneur. As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin I started an underground pop up restaurant, serving in bars, breweries and distilleries and developing a huge following.  Upon graduating I was opening the brick and mortar version of that pop up, which in 2018 won an EATER Award for BEST ROADTRIP RESTAURANT.  feel strongly connected to my great grandmother in the sense of wanting to create spaces where people feel welcomed and that they can be their true selves, while also receiving quality food and service. Martha's Daughter, will be another destination spot. By reviving the idea of a Bed and Breakfast, similar to what my great grandmother ran half a century ago, we can provide travelers with not only a boutique hotel experience but also a chance to stay on a historical landmark, a piece of property that was purchased by an ambitious, middle aged Black Woman 70 years ago and is still in the hands of her descendants. Unfortunately, we are living in a world similar to the one my Gram lived in. 70 years ago, it was not safe everywhere to be Black in America. And we are currently living in a climate where it is again (or still) not safe everywhere to be Black in America. My Gram worked hard her entire life to make sure the racist whites would not take that land away from her. The very least I can do is to fight for it. The purpose of this GoFundMe is to raise money to purchase a portion of this original property and the existing home to renovate into Martha’s Daughter on the Cape. Before she passed, Mrs. Elliott divided her property and divided it among her children. We fortunately have living relatives residing in most of the homes. This past spring my great aunt, and the eldest of Marie’s children passed away. This home is currently for sale and the hope is to purchase this property to keep it in the family and to continue this wonderful family legacy. Photo of the original Wagon Wheel on the Elliott EstastesThe Negro Motorist Greenbook was a guidebook for Black American roadtrippers that wa s published during the Jim Crow Era. It was created and published by a Black NYC mailman named Victor Hugo Green from 1936 - 1966. During Jim Crow Black travelers were constantly at risk of being refused service at gas stations, restaurants and hotels. And even worse threats and physical violence. Green founded the guidebook by compiling resources “to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable.”The Wagon Wheel was included in the Greenbook. As the way my cousins tell it to me, it was a place for notable Black politicians, artists,writers and musicians passed through because there were no other options on that part of the Cape. My cousin, who is the same age as my mother, Martha, told me this story. On a summer day in the late 1960’s she sat on the front porch of the big Victorian house with my great grandmother, or “Gram” as we all refer to her. A view of the Cape Cod Canal sits across the vast green yard that is spotted with Locust trees. While they were enjoying their time together, a car pulled up the horseshoe driveway. A white man got out. He looked at Gram and my cousin and aggressively said to them,  “Someday, we’re gonna take this back from you.”My Gram sat up in her chair, and leaned forward, she took her glasses off and made her eyes real big,  “NOT while my eyes are still open!” She informed the white man. He got in his car and drove away. In 1950, my Gram, a Black female mother and entrepreneur from Cambridge, Massachusetts,  purchased the house and the surrounding almost six acres. She became the first and only Black person to own land in the area. She turned the home into The Wagon Wheel Bed and Breakfast  and named the property The Elliott Estates. Photo of me, my younger sister and Gram in the big house. Martha’s Daughter will be a full service, upscale, Bed & Breakfast. There is a combination of suites and individual rooms throughout the house to accommodate families, couples and singles. The entire home will be available for rental for wedding parties and special events.  Multiple rooms have their own private entrance and bathrooms. Guests will also be able to enjoy the backyard, where there is a koi pond, vegetable garden, and meditation trails. There are two common areas with fireplaces. Included in the stay will be a continental breakfast with fresh juices and coffee and an a la carte menu for purchase.  All menus will be designed by Executive Chef Banda and will feature local ingredients, including vegetables and herbs from the B&B garden.  There will be an option for guests to purchase picnic basket lunches to take to the beach or sack lunches to take on the bike trails. A Martha’s Daughter Food Truck will be available for rental for weddings and specials events. It will also function as a local summer food attraction. Future location of Martha's Daughter Bed & Breakfast"
Wishes,Financial Difficulties,"Johnson City, TN",16405.0,70000.0,173,148,379,"My wife, Roni, and I have faced many  health challenges throughout our 29 years of marriage. We moved back to Johnson City, TN for my wife to be closer to her family. We have been blessed by the support, both financially and emotionally, from our family and friends. However, our out-of-pocket medical bills have continued to escalate to over $64,000 in the past three years (2019 - $11,600; 2018 - $23,500; and 2017 - $29,100). Throughout it all, we have continued to stay true to our faith,family, community, and to one another.This next part continues to be very difficult and embarrassing. We continue to struggle financially.  My monthly salary has been reduced by 50% due to being on short term health disability. I apologize in advance for my lengthly description.  Here is our story on how we got in such a dilemma. Roni is sixty-four(64) years old.  She was an administrative assistant/secretary for over forty (40) years. Unfortunately my loving wife had to quit work due to her health. She was denied disability assistance. Currently she has social security with very limited monthly  benefits.  Her ongoing health concerns include the following:1. Open-heart surgery to repair and replace the major aortic valve for an aortic aneurysm in 1997. This surgery requires her to take Coumadin, a blood thinner medication, and goes to a lab to get tested every month to check on her INR levels.2. In 2007, she developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (brain bleed) because her blood was too thin.  Since that occurrence, she’s had multiple TIA’s (transient ischemic attacks) or mini-strokes. These episodes have resulted in equilibrium/balance problems. She has also shown early stages of short-term memory loss/dementia.3. Ongoing arthritis in both feet and ankle joints that causes her the difficulty to walk.  She cannot take any anti-inflammatory medications (Motrin, Ibuprofen, Advil, etc.) for pain due to being on a blood thinner.4. Right Knee Joint Replacement surgery in 2012.5. Bilateral hearing impairmentrequires her to wear hearing aids in both ears.Consequently, her overall health and memory issues have gradually diminished over the past several years. Although she has battled through all of these challenges, she continues to stay positive in her attitude, faith, and a extremely kind heart.  She means the world to me and her diminishing health has left me heart-broken.I am sixty (60) years old. I have been a secondary school/high school teacher, a college instructor, and a certified athletic trainer for over thirty-two years. I continue to be blessed with a loving wife who has supported me for twenty-nine years of marriage, a supportive family, and the opportunity to try to make a difference in a person’s life. Furthermore, as a certified athletic trainer, I have been involved in the prevention, care, assessment/evaluation, and treatments of athletic/recreational injuries. My health has included the following:1. Open-heart surgery to repair the narrowing of the pulmonary valve at age 12.2. Pancreatic surgery (a Whipple surgical technique) to remove eight (8) precancerous tumors in 2015. This surgery resulted in the removal of portions of my pancreas, colon,intestines, and gall bladder. 3. Approximately one week post-pancreatic surgery, there were complications that resulted in two (2) abdominal aortic valve aneurysms. This resulted in an emergency surgery to repair these ruptures. 4. In 2016, I sustained a total of five (5)retinal detachments on five different occasions and subsequent surgeries after initial cataracts were removed. Four of these detachments occurred in my left eye that resulted in being legally blind and one detachment in my right eye.5. In 2017, I developed a bleeding ulcer which resulted in another hospitalization.Consequently, due to our medical procedures, hospitalizations, surgeries, medications, and follow-up medical care, our financial woes have continued to escalate.I mentioned earlier that our out-of-pocket medical expense was approximately $64,000 over the past three years. But since 2013, we have accumulated over $110,000 in medical debt. To reduce and payoff some of our medical bills, debts, and other financial responsibilities, we had to cash out our 401K’s.We also cashed out our life insurance policies. One might think and ask on why result to this drastic change. The reason was that our monthly premiums were going to triple within the next few months and we just couldn’t afford that dramatic hit with our other financial obligations. We were fortunately able to pay $50,000 of our debt. Unfortunately, I did not realize that we could utilize or set up a medical account at the various medical facilities before placing the amounts on our credit cards. We still owe over $70,000 in credit card debt. This debt was due to paying our medical bills, utilities, groceries/food, apartment rental, etc. We are having difficulty in finding a solution on how we will overcome our financial challenges.

Roni’s hasn’t worked for the past six years.  My medical conditions with their accumulated effects of visual problems, eye pain, persistent headaches, nausea, along with persistent intestinal/digestive issues due to my pancreatic issues, I had to go on disability.  I was unable to fulfill my duties as a teacher and a certified athletic trainer at my previous high school. This reduced my monthly salary by 50%. Furthermore, we moved my wife back to her hometown and closer to her family inJohnson City, Tennessee. We made this move/transition to help with her care.     This location was where we met and got married twenty-nine years ago.

While having a passion in helping others as a teacher and a certified athletic trainer for over thirty-five years, I recently have become very discouraged and often defeated. The reason for these feelings is that I have tried to give so much of myself to others.  I cannot give my wife the financial peace and stability that she deserves.  

She will always be the one that I love, adore, cherish, and who has supported/loved me in return.  I truly believe that these additional stressors are causing an increase in the neurological symptoms/mini-strokes to Roni.  We have faced many health challenges throughout our marriage. We moved back to Johnson City, TN for my wife to be closer to her family. I realize that money and financial stability cannot bring happiness, but it will definitely minimize the stress that is caused by the debt in our daily lives.In closing, I realize that these unprecedented times have left many other organizations/individuals in need and requesting assistance. However, I pray and desperately plea for your urgent assistance. Thank you in advance for everyone’s consideration."
